technology infrastructures, telecommunications networks, and computer processing systems — has provided organizations in the UAE with a platform for delivering innovative services and stimulating economic developmen and communications among individuals. Our dependence on these technologies wi continue to grow in the future, and therefore, the UAE Government is committed to the development of a secure national information and communications infrastructure for UAE organizations and individuals to realize the ful an evolving set of related cyber threats. , as well as facilitating collaboration potential of its benefits, in the face of\n\nAs cyber threa defend against cybersecurity efforts, the UAE Government created the National Electronic Security A) to improve our national cybersecurity, and protect our nationa id communications infrastructure.

Undoubtedly, IT and electronic communication have and will continue to play a pivotal role in the economic development of the UAE and the daily life of its citizens. Therefore, the UAE stands committed to the further development of its national IT and electronic communication infrastructure, as well as its cyberspace, to support economic development and provide an environment where the interests of its governments, businesses, and citizens can thrive.\n\nThe benefits of this technology adoption, however, come with a rapidly evolving set of cyber threats. These threats stem from a wide range of sources — including hacktivists, issue-motivated groups, and organized cybercrime syndicates — and represent national security concerns that can potentially disrupt critical national services and compromise critical information assets.\n\nMitigating cyber threats, and ensuring the development of a secure national information and communications infrastructure, and cyberspace, is a strategic priority for the UAE. To this end, NESA developed the UAE IA Standards as a critical element of the National Information Assurance Framework (NIAF) to provide requirements for elevating the level of IA across all implementing entities in the UAE.\n\nThe development of the UAE IA Standards is based on regional and global best practices including:\n\nISO/IEC 27001:2005 \"Information technology -Security techniques -Information security management systems -Requirements\",\n\nISO/IEC 27002:2005 \"Information technology -Security techniques -Code of practice for Information security management\",\n\nISO/IEC 27005:2005 \"Information technology -Security techniques -Information security risk management\"\n\nISO/IEC 27010:2012 \"Information technology -Security techniques -Information security management for inter-sector and inter-organizational communications\"\n\nISO/IEC 27032:2012 \"Information technology -Security techniques -Guidelines for cybersecurity\"\n\nNIST 800-53 Revision 4 \"Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations\"\n\nAbu Dhabi Information Security Standards Version 1 and Version 2, developed by Abu Dhabi Systems and Information Centre (ADSIC)\n\n. SANS 20 Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense Version 4.1\n\nMoreover the development was guided by key principles including:\n\nApplicability of the common IA requirements across industries , and applicability of the sector-specific IA requirements across entities within each CIIP sector\n\nSupport for the development of the entity, sector, and national-level views of cyber security, to address potential IA risks that emerge from the interconnectivity of entities and sectors\n\nSupport the performance management and the evolution of the controls in these standards based on measuring and sharing effective performance indicators, as well as contributions from key stakeholders to support the ongoing development and refinement of these Standards\n\nCompliance with these Standards will raise the level of national IA and help the UAE progress towards a more resilient national information and communication infrastructure, and cyberspace. All UAE government entities and other entities identified as critical' by NESA are obligated to implement these Standards. However, NESA highly recommends all entities in the UAE to adopt these Standards on a voluntary basis, as applicable, in order to participate in raising the nation minimum-security levels.\n\n+The process for NESA to designate an entity as \"critical\" is outlined in the UAE Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) Policy produced by NESA.\n\n1.2 PURPOSE OF THE UAE IA STANDARDS\n\nThe purpose of the UAE IA Standards is to provide requirements to raise the minimum level of protection of information assets and supporting systems across all implementing entities in the UAE, as outlined in Section 2.1.\n\nIn particular, the UAE IA Standards provides:\n\nDescription of how information assurance is achieved at the national, sector, and entity levels\n\nEnable a risk-based approach for the implementation of these Standards\n\nOutline of the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders for the planning, development, implementation, and ongoing monitoring and improvement of these Standards\n\nReference catalog of common information security controls to defend against common threats that exploit known cyber security vulnerabilities\n\nRealization for sectorial requirements through the provision of specialized controls to address sector-specific information assurance requirements\n\nPhased implementation approach to address the most common threats, facilitate the incremental adoption of these Standards, and optimize the value realized through implementation\n\nDefinition of compliance from the perspective of these Standards and describe the approach that will be adopted by NESA to assess compliance\n\nEnabler for inter-entity and cross-sector communication to support information sharing and build national situational awareness\n\nP=\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\n|\n\nIn summary,\n\nthe implementation\n\nof these Standards will serve to improve the IA protection level\n\nof the UAE critical information infrastructure. As such, this\n\ndocument serves\n\nas the\n\nnational\n\nUAE\n\nIA\n\nStandards that\n\nimplementing entities have to demonstrate compliance with.\n\na\n\nee\n\n]\n\n1.3\n\nLAYOUT OF THE UAE IA STANDARDS\n\nThis section provides an overview of the layout of the UAE IA Standards to guide the readability of this document.\n\nOverall, the UAE IA Standards is composed of seven chapters:\n\nCHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION\n\nThis chapter outlines NESA's rationale for developing the UAE IA Standards and provides an overview of the document layout.\n\nCHAPTER 2: UAE IA STANDARDS OVERVIEW\n\nThis chapter outlines the scope of the document and describes the relationship of the UAE IA Standards with other national cyber security program documents published by NESA (e.g. UAE CIIP Policy). This chapter also describes how information assurance requirements are addressed at the national, sector, and entity levels following a lifecycle approach to progress the adoption and evolution of information assurance in the UAE.\n\nCHAPTER 3: UAE IASTANDARDS IMPLEMENTATION\n\nThis chapter outlines the implementation guidance for entities applying the UAE IA Standards. To help guide the implementation of these Standards, this chapter also provides an overview of the risk-based approach for the identification of applicable controls to be implemented in order to address risks in a manner commensurate with their potential impact. Moreover, this chapter outlines the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders to provide clarity on how to plan, develop, implement, monitor, improve, and report on the implementation of these Standards. Lastly, this chapter concludes by outlining critical success factors for the effective implementation of these Standards.\n\nCHAPTER 4: COMPLIANCE WITH THE UAE IA STANDARDS\n\nThis chapter provides a definition of compliance with respect to the requirements of these Standards, and outlines the approach that NESA will follow when evaluating compliance.\n\nCHAPTER 5: SECURITY CONTROLS\n\nThis chapter details the management and technical security controls, and describes the prioritization approach for implementing these controls, to guide the gradual and phased implementation of these Standards.\n\nCHAPTER 6: ANNEXES\n\nThis chapter provides key reference tools to help stakeholders understand and utilize the security controls including: grouping of controls by priority, cross-referencing of controls to equivalent controls in other key IA standards, mapping of controls against common threats they help to manage, and listing the controls that contain sector and national level requirements. Lastly, this chapter enhances the clarity of the document by providing terms and definitions and a bibliography.\n\nCHAPTER 7: APPENDICES\n\nThe appendices are designed to augment the common information assurance requirements (applicable to all sectors) with sector-specific requirements for all critical sectors as outlined in the UAE CIIP Policy.\n\n2.1\n\nSCOPE\n\nThe UAE IA Standards provides management and technical information security controls (henceforth referred to as \"security controls\") for entities to establish, implement, maintain, and continuously improve information assurance.\n\nNESA will designate the critical entities, as per the UAE CIIP Policy, mandated to implement the UAE IA Standards and apply its requirements to the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information or data, and the systems and processes used for those purposes. This includes information in physical or electronic form that may be owned, leased, or otherwise in the possession, custody, or control of the entities.\n\nRELATED NESA DOCUMENTS\n\nThe UAE IA Standards are critical element of the National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS). Given this, these Standards rely on related and complementary policies issued under the NCSS. Table 1 below describes the relationships and dependencies between the UAE IA Standards and some other NCSS policies:\n\nTABLE 1: OVERVIEW OF DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE UAE IA STANDARDS\n\n[TABLE]\n                                                    DOCUMENT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            RELATIONTOTHEUAEIASTANDARDS\n             National Information Assurance Framework (NIAF)                                                                                                                                                                             The NIAF document outlines key building blocks of the UAEinformation assurance capabilities and program, and specifies the entity, sector, and national information assurance interdependencies and requirements that need to be addressed as part of the UAEIA Standards.\nCritical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) Policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The CIIP Policy establishes the list of sectors and outlines the process for the identification of critical entities where the UAEIA Standards implementation is mandatory.\n            National Cyber Risk Management Framework (NCRMF) The National Cyber Risk Management Framework details the sector and national level risk management approach with regards to Critical National Services and their Critical Information Infrastructure, and provides guidelines on the implementation of risk assessment in this regard. As such, the UAEIA Standards outline key elements to be included in an entity-level risk assessment, to support sector and national risk assessment activities.\n                   National Cyber Information Sharing Policy                                                                                                         The National Cyber Information Sharing policy outlines key requirements for inter-entity and inter-sector communication that serves as a key input to developing national situational awareness. The UAEIA Standards address these requirements by embedding respective Information Sharing security controls that UAEentities will implement.\n[/TABLE]\n\nENTITY, SECTOR, AND NATIONAL CONTEXTS\n\nThe entity, sector, and national contexts refer to the integrated relationships and interactions among individual sector entities, sector regulators, and NESA to form sector and national level views on prevailing [A requirements, corresponding adequacy of IA capabilities, and on-going situational awareness.\n\nWhile IA Standards that exist today prescribe requirements for the entity level, they do not take into account the IA issues that emerge from the systemic interconnectivity of entities at the sector and national levels. This leads to two key shortcomings: first, continued exposure to security threats that no single entity is able to address individually (such as Advanced Persistent Threats), and second, an isolated approach to handling risks related to inter-sector dependencies, often leading to increased efforts, cost, and risk exposure of concerned sectors.\n\nThe UAE IA Standards includes minimum IA requirements and capabilities for UAE entities to integrate into the Sector and National Contexts (refer to Figure 2).\n\nFIGURE 2: NATIONAL, SECTOR AND ENTITY CONTEXT\n\nKEY INFORMATION IS ESCALATED FOR ANALYSIS, AT THE SECTOR AND NATIONAL LEVELS\n\nRELEVANT THREAT AND RISK INFORMATION IS COMMUNICATED TO SECTOR REGULATORS AND ENTITIES\n\nThe development of the sector and national contexts relies on the consolidation and analysis of key entity level information, in particular relating to the state of the UAE IA Standards implementation, risk assessment outcomes, as well as information relating to cyber security threats, risks and incidents. *To enable the sector and national contexts, entities are required to submit UAE IA Standards implementation progress and key cyber security information to sector regulators, who consolidate and analyze the information to form a sector view of risks and assess the sta Similarly, sector regulators are required to submi e of these Standards implementation. the analyzed sector-level information to NESA, to form the national views on critical risks, situational awareness and state of these Standards implementation across sectors.\n\nHaving formed the national view of risks and sta NESA shares relevant risk and UAE IA Standard e of these Standards implementation, s implementation best practices with the sector regulators to enhance the effectiveness of these Standards implementation, as well as the cyber incident management and he cyber risk management programs. Similarly, sector regulators share key risk and implementation related information with relevant entities to progress the implementation of these Standards, and enhance the effectiveness of the incident management and ri sk management programs.\n\nIn summary, the UAE IA Standards is designed to avoid the isolation created by a single-entity approach to IA, hence creating a stronger and more integrated approach for national information assurance.\n\nINFORMATION ASSURANCE LIFECYCLE\n\nThe UAE IA Standards promotes a lifecycle approach for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continuously improving information assurance. This lifecycle approach ensures continual improvement of the UAE's information assurance capabilities based on well-defined activities:\n\nA. UNDERSTANDING an entity's and / or sector's information security requirements and the need to establish a policy and objectives for information security\n\nB. CONDUCTING risk assessments, identifying appropriate risk treatment actions, and selecting controls to manage the risks\n\nC. IMPLEMENTING and operating security controls to manage information security risks in the context of the entity's or sector's overall business risks\n\nD. MONITORING and reviewing the performance and effectiveness of the information security processes and controls\n\nE. ENSURING continual improvement based on objective measurements\n\nThe continuous improvement aspect of the IA lifecycle ensures that IA capabilities are continuously adapted and evolved in line with changing requirements. The application of the IA lifecycle is facilitated best when integrated in the planning and governance activities of an entity or sector.\n\n5.1\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to explain key concepts related to the implementation of the UAE IA Standards such as the risk-based approach to information assurance and the applicability and prioritization of security controls. This chapter also highlights key stakeholder roles and responsibilities for the effective adoption and progression of the UAE IA Standards, and it lists critical implementation success factors.\n\nThe implementation of these Standards is meant to complement any existing information assurance programs at implementing entities. This Standard represents the sole point of reference for compliance against its requirements, as measured by the criteria associated with each of its security controls.\n\nRISK-BASED APPROACH\n\nIn today's world, the cyber threat landscape is evolving rapidly at apace where entities are challenged to keep up with the number and variety of threats. In the face of this growing threat landscape, entities need to adopt practical measures to defend their critical information and information infrastructure against their most critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threats. To this end, a risk-based approach provides entities with a pragmatic mean to identify their most critical vulnerabilities that could expose them to risks, and develop corresponding appropriate treatments.\n\nAdopting a risk-based approach ensures that security controls are instituted in accordance with current risk assessments commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the impact that could result if critical information assets are compromised. The risk-based approach briefly outlined in these Standards summarizes a systematic methodology for identifying, estimating, evaluating, and treating identified entity-level risks. It consists of eight key activities as illustrated in Figure 3.\n\nFIGURE 3: THE RISK-BASED APPROACH PROCESS\n\nPerforming a risk management is a key step towards the implementation of the UAE IA Standards as it helps entities identify, prioritize, and measure the effectiveness of the security controls that are needed to treat identified entity-specific risks. Critical entities implementing these Standards shall also refer to the National Cyber Risk Management Framework (NCRMF) which highlights the National Risk Management approach and process of Critical Information Infrastructure.\n\nACTIVITY 1: ESTABLISHING THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe risk assessment process should be initiated by establishing objectives, strategies, scope and parameters of the activities of the entity, or those parts of the entity where the risk management process is being applied. Further, criteria for assessing risks should be established in line with the entity's objectives, available resources, and the magnitude of impact that could result from the compromise of confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of information assets. Topics such as authenticity and non-repudiation could also be considered based on the entity context.\n\nACTIVITY 2: RISK IDENTIFICATION\n\nThe entity should identify sources of risk, areas of impacts, events and their causes, and the potential consequences. The aim of this step is to generate a comprehensive list of risks based on the identified information security requirements. Because a risk that is not identified at this stage will not be included in further analysis, comprehensive identification is critical.\n\nACTIVITY 3: RISK ESTIMATION\n\nRisk estimation involves consideration of the causes and sources of risk in the form of threats and vulnerabilities, their impacts in terms of consequences of a loss of confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of information, and the likelihood that the potential impacts will occur. The risk should also take into account the effectiveness and efficiency of existing controls in addressing the current level of risk.\n\nACTIVITY 4: RISK EVALUATION\n\nRisk evaluation involves comparing the level of risk found during the risk estimation activity with risk criteria established at the beginning of the process as part of establishing the context (Activity 1). The objective is to determine which risks are outside acceptable parameters and therefore require treatment.\n\nACTIVITY 5: RISK TREATMENT\n\nFor each of the risks identified in the risk assessment, a number of treatment options can be considered and applied either individually, or in combination, for treating the risk. There are several options that are usually considered for treating risks; these options include:\n\n¢ Risk Reduction — Reducing the risk by applying security controls. The selection of security controls should follow a risk-based approach by apply the first set of security controls that treat the highest risks identified during the Risk Evaluation (See 3.4 Prioritization of Controls).\n\n¢ Risk Retention — Accepting the risk based on the entity's risk accepting criteria.\n\n¢ Risk Avoidance — Avoiding the activity or condition causing the risk.\n\n¢ Risk Transfer— Transferring the risk to another party.\n\nACTIVITY 6: RISK ACCEPTANCE\n\nThe risk acceptance is the decision to accept residual risk by the management of the entity. The management based on the acceptance criteria should review and approve the treat plan and the residual risk.\n\nACTIVITY 7: RISK MONITORING AND REVIEW\n\nThe results of the risk assessment and treatment process need to be monitored and reviewed for ongoing risk management, and to ensure their continued suitability. The monitoring and review of information security risks should be a planned part of the risk management process, and involve regular checking or surveillance as well as improvements when significant changes occur. The entity's monitoring and review processes should encompass all aspects of the risk management process, including the risk criteria, the identified assets, threats, risks, risk treatment options and security controls.\n\nACTIVITY 8: RISK COMMUNICATION AND CONSULTATION\n\nCommunication and consultation with key stakeholders should take place during all stages of the risk management process. Therefore, plans for communication and consultation should be developed at an early stage. These should address issues relating to the risk itself, its causes, its consequences (if known), and the measures being taken to treat it. Effective external and internal communication and consultation should take place to ensure that stakeholders and those accountable for implementing the risk management process understand the basis on which decisions are made, as well as the reasons why particular actions are required.\n\n5.5\n\nAPPLICABILITY OF CONTROLS\n\nThe concept of Applicability relates to the identification of security controls for treating entity-specific risks as outlined in [Step 5] of the risk assessment process described above (section 3.2).\n\nThe security controls included in these Standards are developed to treat a typical entity risk profile developed based on benchmark risk registers. While this common risk profile is widely applicable to implementing entities, NESA recognizes that entity risk profiles do differ based on their specific business and operational context. Given these differences, not all security controls provided in these Standards might be applicable to all entities. Therefore, these Standards require that the identification of the security controls be based on an entity risk assessment resulting in applicable security controls for the treatment of identified risks.\n\nPrior to performing the risk assessment process, an entity should consider all security controls to be applicable. However, an individual entity may exclude some security controls on the basis of the risk assessment outcomes, provided that adequate justification is submitted to NESA.\n\nMoreover, certain security controls included in these Standards represent requirements for instituting foundational IA capabilities within an entity, and as such, are considered \"Always Applicable\". Given their foundational role, the \"Always Applicable\" security controls shall be implemented by each relevant entity regardless of its risk assessment outcomes (refer to Annex 1 for a summary of \"Always Applicable\" controls).\n\nr=\n\n=~\n\n—~\n\n=~\n\n|—_\n\n|—_\n\n|=\n\nS|\n\nS|\n\nS|\n\nSE\n\nSE\n\nS-\n\n=\n\nIn summary, the concept of Applicability identifies the security controls that I are mandatory for implementation based on the list of applicable controls\n\nresulting from the entity risk assessment process, above and beyond the\n\nI \"Always Applicable\" controls. Inthe absence of an entity risk assessment, all\n\nthe security controls detailed in these Standards deemed applicable and\n\ntherefore mandatory for implementation.\n\nare I\n\nLr er\n\ni\n\noo\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nPRIORITIZATION OF CONTROLS\n\nThe concept of Prioritization relates to grouping the UAE IA Standards security controls in order ofimportance for realizing aminimum level of information assurance protection, and for enabling a phased and incremental implementation of these Standards.\n\nThe prioritization approach of the UAE IA Standards is based on the relative impact of security controls in helping implementing entities to:\n\n+ Mitigate common threats\n\n* Build foundational IA capabilities\n\nBased on these criteria, the security controls are grouped into four priority levels — P 1, P2, P3, and P4 in this order of importance — and the outcome of the prioritization is included in Annex 2.\n\nWhile all the applicable security controls across the four priority levels are mandatory for critical entities implementing these Standards, they are required to begin implementing these Standards with P1 security controls given their highest relative impactin protecting against critical threats and building foundational information assurance capabilities.\n\nCritical entities implementing these Standards may alter (promote or demote) the suggested priority of controls based on the outcomes of their risk assessment, with the exception of top priority controls (P1), which if applicable, may be augmented but never reduced (refer to Figure 4).\n\nFIGURE 4: CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW OF PRIORITIZATION OF SECURITY CONTROLS\n\n5.5\n\nKEY STAKEHOLDERS ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe successful implementation and progression of the UAE IA Standards is a shared responsibility among key stakeholders. Therefore, planning, development, implementation, as well as monitoring and reporting responsibilities are assigned to key stakeholders, as described in Table 2 below:\n\nTABLE 2: UAE IA STANDARDS STAKEHOLDER ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n[TABLE]\n          0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\nSTAKEHOLDER                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        UAEIASTANDARDSROLESANDRESPONSIBILITIES\n       NESA ROLE Provide strategic leadership and governance, coordinate stakeholder involvement for the development and implementationoftheUAEIA Standards, and ensure ongoing compliance monitoring, and information sharing RESPONSIBILITIES IASTANDARDSPLANNINGANDDEVELOPMENT • InformationAssuranceStrategyDevelopment - Provide strategic priorities for the development of the commonandsector-specific requirements of the UAEIAStandards • SecurityRequirementsDevelopment - Establish the UAEIAStandards security requirements in collaboration with key stakeholders including sector regulators, critical entities and cyber security experts • UAEIAStandardsIssuance - Approve and publish the UAEIAStandards as developed in collaboration with the key stakeholders IASTANDARDSIMPLEMENTATION NESAis responsible for facilitating the implementationoftheUAEIA Standards, but does not have direct responsibilities in the implementation\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n#           STAKEHOLDER                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         UAEIASTANDARDSROLESANDRESPONSIBILITIES\n2     SECTOR REGULATORS ROLE Actively contribute to the development of the UAEIAStandards in collaboration with NESA, developing sector specific IA requirements/ controls, and ensure UAEIAStandards compliance reporting as well as information sharing RESPONSIBILITIES IASTANDARDSPLANNINGANDDEVELOPMENT • UAEIAStandardsDevelopment - Provide input in the development of the UAEIAStandards security requirements in collaboration withNESA • Sector-SpecificRequirementsDevelopment -AugmentUAEIA Standards with sector-specific requirements pertinent to each\n3 IMPLEMENTING ENTITIES                                             ROLE Implement the UAE IA Standards, and report on implementation progress andcompliance, aswellasshareinsightsonsecuritycontrolseffectiveness RESPONSIBILITIES IASTANDARDSPLANNINGANDDEVELOPMENT • IAStandardsDevelopment - Provide input in the development the UAEIAStandards security requirements in collaboration withNESA through the IATFs 3 • EntityImplementationPlanDevelopment - Develop an implementation plan for the adopting/applying the UAEIAStandards IASTANDARDSIMPLEMENTATION\n[/TABLE]\n\nKEY SUCCESS FACTORS\n\nThe implementation of the UAE IA Standards guided by the following key success factors: and related security controls should be\n\nA.

PARTICIPATE, and contribute in sharing information assurance best practices and lessons learned with sector regulators and other implementing entities\n\n-ENSURE visible support and commitment from all levels of management\n\nPROVISION adequate funding for all information assurance activities\n\nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE UAE IA STANDARDS\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to provide a definition of compliance with respect to the requirements of these Standards and to outline the measurement criteria and approach that NESA will follow when evaluating compliance.\n\nWithin the context of this Standard, compliance refers to the comparison between the requirements outlined in this Standard and the actual state of implementation of these requirements within an entity. This can be measured on an individual control basis, as well as the degree of compliance of an entity overall with the complete set of requirements. Increasing the level of compliance with the security controls provided in this Standard is the key to ensuring immediate and long lasting improvements of information assurance within the UAE and the overall success of the UAE's Information Assurance program.\n\nTo this end, NESA will ensure that an effective compliance monitoring scheme is in place which provides NESA with the visibility of the current status of compliance with this Standard and the activities needed for improving the overall security of the UAE's cyberspace. The compliance monitoring scheme is outlined in the UAE NIAF Governance and is based on the following four elements:\n\nCONTROLS\n\nAll security controls specified in the UAE IA Standards need to be considered by each entity, and any entity wishing to claim compliance with these Standards shall implemen these controls based on the following requirements:\n\n* Controls that are \"Always Applicable\" — these security controls are essential and shall be implemented by any entity wishing to claim compliance with the UAE IA Standards. Omission of any of these controls is not acceptable and constitutes non-conformity.\n\n+ Controls that are applicable based on the risk assessment — the entity shal determine which of the security controls provided in the UAE IA Standards are applicable in its particular situation based on the results of the risk assessment. Any exclusion of these controls needs to be justified and evidence needs to be provided such that the associated risks have been accepted by accountable persons or authorizing entities.\n\nThe overall set of security controls that are \"Always Applicable\" and those security controls that have been determined as being applicable based on the risk assessmen are \"mandatory\" for the entity to implement, and will be the basis of the compliance monitoring scheme.\n\nSUB-CONTROLS\n\nFor each of the security controls, aset of sub-controls are specified. These sub-controls specify mandatory implementation requirements. Also, it is expected that each entity claiming compliance shall implement the selected security controls by complying with the sub-controls during the implementation process as described below.\n\nThe entity shall implement all of the sub-controls of the \"Always Applicable\" security controls. Omission of any of these sub-controls is not acceptable and constitutes nonconformity to the UAE IA Standards.\n\nThe entity can decide to not implement a sub-control of a security control identified by the risk assessment, if this action is appropriately justified (e.g. following the risk assessment or due to decisions or circumstances in the entity), or to implement the sub-controls in a different way. Any deviation from the sub-controls needs to be justified and evidence needs to be provided such that the associated risks have been accepted by accountable persons or authorizing entities.\n\nPERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\np S it erformance indicators are intended to provide entities implementing the UAE IA tandards with some basic guidelines to measure the quality and effectiveness of Ss compliance with the control sub-families and controls of this Standard. Entities implementing this Standard can deviate from these performance indicators, but are required to provide a reason for this deviation and to specify the new performance indicators when doing so.\n\nFor compliance with this Standard, entities need to use performance indicators to measure the quality and effectiveness of the implemented security controls.\n\nAUTOMATION, THREAT/VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION FOR SUB-FAMILIES OF CONTROLS, AND IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FOR CONTROLS\n\ntT he information on possible automation and the implementation guidance for security controls are provided for information purposes only and can be implemented as the e hreats and vulnerabilities are also provided for information purposes. ntity prefers, without any further explanation or justification. Descriptions of typical a n summary, NESA places a high level of importance on understanding and improving he level of compliance with this Standard as one of the core elements of increasing he level of success of the UAE's information assurance program. At the same time, NESA understands that individual entities face specific circumstances that require a certain level of flexibility to manage properly. As such, this Standard aims to strike an ppropriate balance of mandatory requirements versus suggested security controls. This is based on the risk-based approach that each entity shall develop internally in order to make appropriate and justified decisions. Moreover, all implementing entities are welcomed and encouraged to share their experience in regard to the implementation ° f the security controls.\n\nCONTROL STRUCTURE\n\nThe hierarchy of control families, control sub-families and individual controls are structured as follows:\n\nCONTROL FAMILY STRUCTURE\n\n[TABLE]\n                    0                                                            1\n CONTROL FAMILYNUMBER                                            CONTROLFAMILYNAME\n            OBJECTIVE                   High level objective of the control family\nPERFORMANCE INDICATOR Metrics that measure the effectiveness of the control family\n[/TABLE]\n\nSUB-FAMILY STRUCTURE\n\n[TABLE]\n                                 0                                                                                                    1\n            CONTROL SUB-FAMILYNAME                                                                              CONTROLSUB-FAMILYNUMBER\n                         OBJECTIVE                                                       High level objective of the control sub-family\n             PERFORMANCE INDICATOR                                     Metrics that measure the effectiveness of the control sub-family\n               AUTOMATION GUIDANCE    Description of procedures and / or tools to automate the implementation of the control sub-family\nRELEVANTTHREATS ANDVULNERABILITIES The most prevalent and damaging attack types against which the control sub-family ensures protection\n[/TABLE]\n\nCONTROL STRUCTURE\n\n[TABLE]\n                                  CONTROL NUMBER.

starting the design and implementation of information security within an entity, it is mportant to evaluate and understand both the external and internal context of this entity, since hese can significantly influence the design of information security solutions. For the external 'actors, this activity should include topics such as:\n\nThe industry sector, legal, regulatory, financial, technological, economic, political, natural and competitive environment, whether international, national, regional or local\n\nKey drivers and trends having impact on the information security objectives of the entity\n\nRelationships with, and dependencies of, external stakeholders\n\nhe evaluation of internal factors should address topics such as:\n\nGovernance, organizational structure, roles and accountabilities\n\nCapabilities, understood in terms of resources and knowledge (e.g. capital, time, people, processes, systems and technologies)\n\nInformation systems, information flows and decision making processes\n\nRelationships with, and perceptions of, internal stakeholders\n\nThe form and extent of contractual relationships\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\ni\n\n:\n\ni\n\nH\n\n:\n\n:\n\n;\n\ni\n\n:\n\n[TABLE]\n          0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n     M1.1.2                                                                                                                                                                                                               LEADERSHIPAND MANAGEMENT COMMITMENT PRIORITY APPLICABILITY\n    CONTROL                                                                                                                                                                         The entity's top management shall demonstrate leadership and commitment to information security.\n            Top management commitment shall: 1) Ensure the information security policy and the information security objectives are established and are compatible with the strategic direction of the entity 2) Ensure the integration of the information security requirements into\nSUB-CONTROL                                       are available 4) Communicate the importance of the effectiveness of information security management 5) Direct and support persons to contribute to the effectiveness of information security and conforming to the requirements of\n[/TABLE]\n\nMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)\n\nop management commitment and its visible demonstration is one important contributor '0 the overall success of information security within an entity. This does not mean that top management is carrying out the actions listed above themselves, but they need to ensure that he actions do take place, and that they are concluded successfully.\n\nOne important part in these responsibilities is the assignment of appropriate resources, ithout which information security cannot succeed (see also M1.4.1 below). Another important spect is the connection between business goals and requirements and information security. ideally, this is a balance between these items, and it should never be the case that information ecurity hinders the business. It should, of course, also not be the case that an entity takes any njustified risks and neglects security. The final decision what takes preference has to be taken yy top management.\n\nManagement should identify the needs for internal or external specialist information security vice, and review and coordinate results of the advice throughout the entity.\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n;\n\n|\n\n:\n\n[TABLE]\n          0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n     M1.1.3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ROLESAND RESPONSIBILITIES FORINFORMATION SECURITY PRIORITY APPLICABILITY\n    CONTROL                                                                                                                                                                                         The entity shall ensure that the responsibilities and authorities of roles for information security are assigned and communicated.\nSUB-CONTROL Top management shall assign the responsibility and the authority for: 1) Ensuring that the information security implemented in the entity conforms to the requirements of the UAEIA Standards 2) Reporting on the performance of information security to top management Top management shall ensure that 3) An Information\n[/TABLE]\n\nMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)\n\nhe roles of the \"Information Security Manager\" and the \"Information Security Committee\" are mportant contributors to successful information security, and have therefore been defined as ub-controls.

(see also T7.7) • Identify existing information security controls • Identifying threats and threat sources 2) Identify the risk owners 3) Document the results of the risk identification.\n[/TABLE]\n\nMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)\n\nhere is a lot of information related to the performance of information security risk ssessments; therefore, this implementation guidance will just provide an overview of the most mportant concepts. Entities should take into account relevant NESA's issuances and guidance ith regard to risk management when performing risk assessment.\n\nEVEL OF DETAIL OF THE INFORMATION SECURITY RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nome entities might find it difficult or time consuming to conduct a detailed risk assessment. The hoice of a suitable risk management approach should be taken when drafting the Information ecurity Risk Management Policy (refer to M2.1.1), and the implementation guidance there xplains the considerations the entity should take into account when deciding ona suitable way Ff doing information security risk management. The entity should document these results and hould be able to provide reasons for the decision taken.\n\nn entity will only be considered as being compliant with the requirements of this Standard if hey apply a suitable information security risk management policy.\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\ni\n\n|\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\nH\n\n:\n\nSSET IDENTIFICATION\n\nhe assets to be considered in the information security risk assessment are all information ssets, i.e. include:\n\nINFORMATION: Databases, files, contracts and agreements, system documentation, research information, user manuals, training material, operational or support procedures, etc.\n\nSOFTWARE ASSETS: Application software, system software, development tools, and utilities\n\n. PHYSICAL ASSETS: Computer equipment, communications equipment, removable media\n\n. OTHER EQUIPMENT\n\nSERVICES: Computing and communications services, general utilities, e.g. heating, lighting, power, and air-conditioning\n\n. PEOPLE, and their qualifications, skills, and experience\n\n. INTANGIBLES, such as reputation and image of the entity\n\nhe identified assets are summarized in the Asset Inventory (refer to T1.2.1). it might be useful to summarize assets in suitable groups (e.g. all PCs in a call center, processing he same type of information), but care should be taken to only group \"like with like\" when doing 0. Itis also helpful to take account of business processes, as they often can help to understand he information flow and how assets are working in the entity.\n\nDENTIFICATION OF THREATS\n\nhreats are not very dependent on the entity and its business; they are just out there trying to ucceed. When identifying threats, it can be helpful to use threat lists (e.g. those provided in his Standard, or in other standards, such as ISO/IEC 27005), and to look into incident reports incidents are always related to threats that have been successfuland audit reports, and to ep an open mind to the latest development as new threats will continue to emerge. It is also mportant to not only look at threats from the outside, such as hackers or malware, but also onsider inside threats. A disgruntled employee with given access rights can often do more amage as outsiders.\n\nDENTIFICATION OF VULNERABILITIES\n\nhe identification of vulnerabilities should be based on an assessment of the existing controls. 0 do so, it is recommended to conduct a gap analysis, which checks the controls in place gainst this Standard. The results of the gap analysis form an input in the identification of ulnerabilities as well as into the assessment of the risk likelihood (see also M2.2.2 below). Any ontrol, which has been identified as missing, not completely in place, not fully documented or jot complied with identifies at least one (if not morevulnerabilities, which might be exploited y the identified threats.\n\nLEASE NOTE: The identification of threats and vulnerabilities takes place per each identified asset, 0 this easily produces a lot of information. To keep the amount of information manageable, it is 'ecommended to:\n\nIdentify threats and vulnerabilities with the existing controls in mind\n\nIdentify only threat/vulnerability pairs where the threat will actually exploit the vulnerability\n\nee also T 7.7 on Technical Vulnerability Management\n\n:\n\n|\n\n:\n\n;\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\ni\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n|\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\n:\n\n;\n\n:\n\n[TABLE]\n                                                0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n                                           M2.2.2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                INFORMATION SECURITYRISK ANALYSIS PRIORITY P1 APPLICABILITY ALWAYSAPPLICABLE\n                                          CONTROL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The entity shall analyze its information security risks.\n                                      SUB-CONTROL The entity shall: 1) Assess the potential consequences that would result if the identified risks were to materialize by assessing the consequences of losses of confidentiality, integrity or availability 2) Assess the realistic likelihood of the occurrence of the identified risks based on the existing controls, identified vulnerabilities and threats 3) Determine the levels of risk 4) Document the results of the risk analysis\nIMPLEMENTATIONGUIDANCE(FORINFORMATIONPURPOSEONLY)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           IMPLEMENTATIONGUIDANCE(FORINFORMATIONPURPOSEONLY)\n[/TABLE]\n\nhereis alot ofinformation related to the performance of information security riskassessments, nd more details will be provided in a separate risk management document, therefore, this mplementation guidance will just provide an overview of the most important concepts.\n\nonsequences of losses of confidentiality, integrity or availability: The first part of assessing he consequences of losses of confidentiality, integrity or availability is to identify the business mportance the information asset under consideration has. Damage to an asset that is important for the business is much likelier to cause severe consequences than an asset that is ot as important. Based on the business use of the asset, the consequences for a loss of the 'ollowing needs to be assessed:\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY — This means the information asset is only accessible to those authorized to access it\n\nINTEGRITY — This means the information asset has not been modified in any unauthorized way\n\n. AVAILABILITY — This means the information asset is available, when needed\n\no make the results of this assessment comparable, scales should be used, which should have een defined in the Information Security Risk Management Policy (see M2.1.1 above).\n\nhe assessment of these consequences should be done together with the business users of he information assets, as these can give important input into the process because they are ware of the security requirements for their assets. This can be done by interviews and/or uestionnaires, but it is important to ensure that the business users understand what is asked rom them.\n\ns aresult, each asset should have identified consequences of losses of confidentiality, integrity\n\n!\n\ni\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n!\n\n:\n\n:\n\n;\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\nIKELIHOOD OF THREAT/VULNERABILITY COMBINATIONS\n\nssssS—S\n\nhe input into the assessment of the likelihood that a particular threat exploits a vulnerability is ased on very similar considerations as the identification of threats and vulnerabilities (see M2.2.1 bove). The likelinood of a threat occurring can be derived from threat catalogues and statistics, s well as incident records, audit logs and reports, etc. the entity has produced.\n\nhe level of vulnerability is based on how good or bad the controls are that have been put in place, 0 this can also be derived from the results of the gap analysis (see M2.2.1 above).

Effective external and internal communication and consultation should take place to ensure that stakeholders and those accountable for implementing the risk management process understand the basis on which decisions are made, as well as the reasons why particular actions are required.\n\n:\n\ni\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\nM3 AWARENESS AND TRAINING\n\n[TABLE]\n                         0                                                                                                                                                               1\n                        M3                                                                                                                                            AWARENESSANDTRAINING\n                 OBJECTIVE                                                Toensure sufficient information security awareness and training is provided and to build a specialized workforce\n     PERFORMANCE INDICATOR                                                                                 Percentage of awareness and training objectives that have been met successfully\n                      M3.1                                                                                                                                      AWARENESSANDTRAININGPOLICY\n                 OBJECTIVE To maintain an awareness and training policy outlining the approach to identifying relevant topics, enrollment of stakeholders, and documentation of activities\n     PERFORMANCE INDICATOR                                                 Trend in the number of employees that have not successfully participated in the awareness and training program.\n       AUTOMATION GUIDANCE                                                                                                                                                  Not applicable\n                  RELEVANT                                                                 • Unsuitable awareness and training policy • Non-comprehensive training identification approach\nTHREATSAND VULNERABILITIES                                                                                                         • Accidental information leaks due to lack of awareness\n[/TABLE]\n\nH\n\n:\n\nH\n\n[TABLE]\n          0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n     M3.1.1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    AWARENESSAND TRAININGPOLICY PRIORITY APPLICABILITY\n    CONTROL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The entity shall develop and maintain an awareness and training policy.\nSUB-CONTROL The awareness and training policy shall: 1) Be appropriate to the purpose of the entity 2) Provide the framework for setting awareness and training objectives 3) Facilitate the implementation of the associated controls 4) Outline the roles and responsibilities of providers and recipients of awareness and training activities\n[/TABLE]\n\n:\n\ni\n\n:\n\nCritical entities shall also take into account NESA's relevant issuances, guidance, and activities with regards to National Awareness and Capability Building.\n\n:\n\n:\n\nThe policy document should contain statements concerning:\n\nA.

This type of auditing should not come as a surprise ut should be planned in advance, and the auditor should provide an audit plan of the areas to e audited and people to be met, to ensure the audit does not disrupt the business processes more than necessary (see also the sub-controls above).\n\nOne of the important concepts of internal audits is the independence of the internal auditor(s) arrying out the audits. If the necessary independence or expertise cannot be found within the ntity, external resources can provide this service. If the entity uses external resources, care hould be taken to ensure that the external resource have enough knowledge of the entity to uccessfully conduct the audit.\n\nnother important aspect of the internal audit is the entity's reaction to its results. The results f the internal audits should be considered by the Information Security Committee (refer to 1.1.2), and it should be ensured that all findings of the audit are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n:\n\n:\n\n!\n\nH\n\ni\n\n:\n\n:\n\n!\n\nH\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\nH\n\n:\n\n:\n\n[TABLE]\n                                  0                                                                                                                                                                           1\n                               M6.3                                                                                                                                                                 IMPROVEMENT\n                          OBJECTIVE                                                               Tocorrect nonconformities with this Standard andtocontinually improve the information security programinplace\n              PERFORMANCE INDICATOR                                                                       Number of all non-conformities that have been detected and not resolved within the time frame planned\n                AUTOMATION GUIDANCE                                                                                                                                                              Not applicable\nRELEVANT THREATSAND VULNERABILITIES • Non-compliance with the controls in this Standard • Repeated incidents and inappropriate action to information security problems • Noimprovements to information security\n[/TABLE]\n\nCORRECTIVE\n\n;\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\nThe entity shall react to the nonconformity when it occurs, and take action to control and correct it, and to deal with the consequences.

Theentity could useatooltoautomatethefollowingprocesses: • Tracking of information asset inventory, • Assignmentofinformation assets ownership • Defining the right use of information assets Some entities maintain asset inventories using specific large-scale commercial products dedicated to the task, or they use free solutions to track and then sweep the network periodically for new assets connected to it. In particular, when entities acquire new systems, they record the owner andfeaturesofeachnewasset,includingitsnetworkinterfaceMediaAccess Control (MAC) address and location. This mapping of asset attributes and owner-to-MAC address can be stored in a free or commercial database managementsystem. The entity should determine which asset attributes, based on entity's needs, should be tracked.

To ensure anti-virus signatures are up to date, entities use automation. They use the built-in administrative features of enterprise endpoint security suites to verify that anti-virus, anti-spyware, and host-based IDS featuresareactiveoneverymanagedsystem.Theyrun automated assessments daily and review the results to find and mitigate systems that have deactivated such protections, as well as systems that do not have the latest malware definitions. Some entities deploy free or commercial honeypot and tarpit tools to identify attackers in their environment. Security personnel should continuously monitor honeypots and tarpits to determine whether traffic is directed to them and account logins are attempted. When they identify such events, these personnel should gather the source address from which this traffic originates and other details associated with the attack for follow-on investigation.\nRELEVANT THREATSAND VULNERABILITIES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               • Spyware • Backdoor or commandandcontrol • SQLinjection\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n          0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n     T3.4.1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                CONTROLS AGAINST MALWARE\n    CONTROL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The entity shall protect its information assets from malware.\nSUB-CONTROL The entity shall: 1) Employ anti-malware protection mechanisms for the network as well as servers, workstations, laptops and other devices connected to it 2) Ensure that all anti-malware protection are up-to-date 3) Periodically scan all information systems files as well as files downloaded from public networks 4) Scan all email attachments before reaching user's inbox 5) Scan removable media for malware every time they are connected to the information systems 6) Configure servers, workstations, laptops so that they don't 'auto- run' contents from removable media 7) Monitor anti-malware protection tools for malware detection events that should be logged and a notification should be sent to the administrators (refer to T.3.6.2) 8) Ensure that users are aware of malware risks, behaviors and preventative actions (refer to M.3.2.1)\n[/TABLE]\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\nH\n\ni\n\n:\n\ni\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)\n\nMalware includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware.

AUTOMATION GUIDANCE Most free and commercial operating systems, network services, and firewall technologies offer logging capabilities. Such logging should be activated, with logs sent to centralized logging servers. Firewalls, proxies, and remote access systems (VPN, dial-up, etc.) should all be configured for verbose logging, storing all the information available for logging in the event a follow- up investigation is required. Furthermore, operating systems, especially those of servers, should be configured to create access control logs when a user attempts to access resources without the appropriate privileges. To evaluate whether such logging is in place, an entity should periodically scan through its logs and compare them with the asset inventory in order to ensure that each managed item actively connected to the network is periodically generating logs. Analytical programs such as SIM/SEM solutions for reviewing logs can provide value, but the capabilities employed to analyze audit logs are quite extensive, including, importantly, evenjust a cursory examination by a person. Actual correlation tools can make audit logs far more useful for subsequent manual inspection. Such tools can be quite helpful in identifying subtle attacks. However, these tools are neither a panacea nor a replacement for skilled information security personnel and system administrators.

In particular, he following items should be considered:\n\nOperational responsibility for networks should be separated from computer operations where appropriate\n\nResponsibilities and procedures for the management of remote equipment, including equipment in user areas, should be established\n\nSpecial controls may be required to maintain the availability of the network services and computers connected\n\nManagement activities should be closely coordinated both to optimize the service to the entity and to ensure that controls are consistently applied across the information processing infrastructure\n\nurther measures can include:\n\nmplement ingress and egress filtering to allow only those ports and protocols with an explicit and documented business need\n\nRestrict access only to trusted sites (white lists)\n\nnspect packets on DMZ networks using Security Event Information Management (SEIM) or jog analytics systems\n\nDeploy Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records in DNS and enabling receiver-side verification in mail servers\n\nDisable / uninstall unused services:\n\nEnable host-based firewalls or port filtering tools on end systems with a default-deny rule that drops all traffic except those services and ports that are explicitly allowed\n\nRegularly scan port on all key servers, and compare results to a known effective baseline\n\nBackup and protect firewall,

A graduated set of controls can be applied n different logical network domains to further segregate the network security environments, .g. publicly accessible systems, internal networks, and critical assets. The domains should e defined based on a risk assessment and the different security requirements within each of he domains.\n\nuch a network perimeter can be implemented by installing a secure gateway between the wo networks to be interconnected to control access and information flow between the two lomains. This gateway should be configured to filter traffic between these domains and to block nauthorized access in accordance with the entity's access control policy. An example of this ype of gateway is what is commonly referred to as a firewall. Another method of segregating eparate logical domains is to restrict network access by using virtual private networks for user roups within the entity.\n\nletworks can also be segregated using the network device functionality, e.g. IP switching. eparate domains can then be implemented by controlling the network data flows using the 'outing/switching capabilities, such as access control lists.\n\nhe criteria for segregation of networks into domains should be based on the access control jolicy and access requirements, and also take account of the relative cost and performance mpact of incorporating suitable network routing or gateway technology.\n\nn addition, segregation of networks should be based on the value and classification of nformation stored or processed in the network, levels of trust, or lines of business, in order to reduce the total impact of a service disruption.\n\n:\n\ni\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n;\n\n:\n\n:\n\nH\n\ni\n\n:\n\n:\n\n;\n\n:\n\ni\n\n;\n\n:\n\n:\n\ni\n\n:\n\n[TABLE]\n          0                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n     T4.5.4                                                                                                             SECURITYOF WIRELESS NETWORKS PRIORITY APPLICABILITY BASEDONRISK ASSESSMENT\n    CONTROL                                                                                                             The entity shall ensure that all wireless networks are adequately secured.\n            The entity shall: 1) Undertake and document a site survey to determine the optimal physical locations to avoid stray signal leaking too far outside of the entity's physical perimeter\nSUB-CONTROL                          2) Identify criteria for grouping information services, users, and information systems into different groups that facilitate segregation on wireless networks\n[/TABLE]\n\nMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)\n\n:\n\nonsideration should be given to the segregation of wireless networks from internal and private | etworks.

GUIDANCE Built-in operating system features can extract lists of accounts with super-user privileges, both locally on individual systems and on overall domain controllers. To verify that users with high-privileged accounts do not use such accounts for day-to-day web surfing and e-mail reading, security personnel should periodically gather a list of running processes to determine whether any browsers or e-mail readers are running with high privileges. Such information gathering can be scripted, with short shell scripts searching for a dozen or more different browsers, e-mail readers, and document editing programs running with high privileges on machines. Some legitimate system administration activity may require the execution of such programs over the short term, but long-term or frequent use of such programs with administrative privileges could indicate that an administrator is not adhering to this control. Monitoring tools can provide such information.\nRELEVANT THREATSAND VULNERABILITIES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             • Abuse of system access/privileges • Backdoor or CommandandControl • Disable or interfere with security controls • Tampering in network utilities\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n          0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n     T5.5.1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           SECURELOG-ON PROCEDURES PRIORITY APPLICABILITY\n    CONTROL                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The entity shall control access to systems and applications using a secure log-on and log-off procedure.\nSUB-CONTROL The entity shall: 1) Identify the systems, applications and services that require user authentication 2) Classify the identified systems, application and services based onthe level of protection needed 3) Establish the appropriate log-on and log-off procedures to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access\n[/TABLE]\n\nMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)\n\nventhoughmost applications have secure log-onimplemented, a suitable authenticationtechnique hould be chosen to substantiate the claimed identity of a user.

manyentities usetools to pull information from network assets such as switches and routers regarding the machines connected to the network. Using securely authenticated and encrypted network management protocols, tools can retrieve MAC addresses and other information from network devices that can be reconciled with the entity'sassetinventoryofservers,workstations,laptops,andotherdevices. Once MAC addresses are confirmed, switches should implement 802.1x and NAC to only allow authorized systems that are properly configured to connect to the network. Going further, effective entities configure free or commercial network scanning tools to perform network sweeps on a regular basis, sending a variety of different packet types to identify devices connected to the network. Before such scanning can take place, entities should verify that they have adequate bandwidth for such periodic scans by consulting load history and capacities for their networks. In conducting inventory scans, scanning tools could send traditional ping packets (ICMP Echo Request) looking for ping responses to identify a system at a given IP address.

When evaluating the effectiveness of testing for these weaknesses, MITRE's Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification can be used to organize and record the breadth of the testing fortheCWEsandtoenabletesterstothinklikeattackersintheirdevelopment of test cases.\nRELEVANT THREATSAND VULNERABILITIES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             • Software malfunction • Illegal processing of data • Injection flaws,suchasSQL,OS,andLDAP • Broken Authentication and Session Management • Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n[/TABLE]\n\ni\n\ni\n\n:\n\ni\n\n|\n\n[TABLE]\n          0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1                                                                                                         2                                                                                                         3\n     T7.3.1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        INPUTDATA VALIDATION                                                                                      INPUTDATA VALIDATION                                                                                    PRIORITY APPLICABILITY\n    CONTROL                                                                                                                                                                   The entity shall validate data input to applications to ensure that this data is correct and appropriate.

are available to evaluate the security configuration of systems. Some entities have also found commercial services using remotely managed scanning appliances to be effective. To help standardize the definitions of discovered vulnerabilities in multiple departments of an entity or even across entities it is preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that measure security flaws and map them to vulnerabilities and issues categorized using one or more of the following industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration, and platform classification schemesandlanguages:CVE,CCE,OVAL,CPE,CVSS,and/orXCCDF. Advancedvulnerabilityscanningtoolscanbeconfiguredwithusercredentials to log in to scanned systems and perform more comprehensive scans than can be achieved without login credentials. The frequency of scanning activities, however, should increase as the diversity of an entity's systems increases to account for the varying patch cycles of eachvendor. In addition to the scanning tools that check for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across the network, various free and commercial tools can evaluate security settings and configurations of local machines on which they are installed.

tools are available. Some enterprises have also found commercial services using remotely managed scanning appliances to be effective. To help standardize the definitions of discovered vulnerabilities in multiple departments of an entity or evenacross entities, it is preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that measure security flaws and map them to vulnerabilities and issues categorized using one or more of the following industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration, and platform classification schemes and languages: CVE, CCE, OVAL, CPE, CVSS, and/or XCCDF. Advanced vulnerability scanning tools can be configured with user credentials to log in to scanned systems and perform more comprehensivescansthancanbeachievedwithoutlogincredentials.The frequency of scanning activities, however, should increase as the diversity of an entity's systems increases to account for the varying patch cycles of each vendor. Also, event log collectors and incident management systems should be considered. These technologies provide log collection, normalization, correlation and analysis: they can be very helpful both to detect incidents in their early stages and to investigate incidents.\nRELEVANT THREATSAND VULNERABILITIES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               • Leakage of reported weaknesses • Unsuitable reporting procedures\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n                                                0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n                                           T8.3.1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          SITUATIONAL AWARENESS PRIORITY APPLICABILITY BASEDONRISK ASSESSMENT\n                                          CONTROL                                                                                                                                                                                                                The entity shall develop a situational awareness culture by participating in the information sharing community and obtaining cyber security information from various sources.\n                                      SUB-CONTROL The entity shall: 1) Identify priority information and share it internally to build the entity context 2) For the sector context, identify and share priority information that is relevant to entities in the same sector to build the sector context 3) For the national context, identify and share priority information that is relevant across all sectors to build the national context\nIMPLEMENTATIONGUIDANCE(FORINFORMATIONPURPOSEONLY)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            IMPLEMENTATIONGUIDANCE(FORINFORMATIONPURPOSEONLY)\n[/TABLE]\n\n:\n\n:\n\n©\n\n:\n\n:\n\n_\n\n}\n\ni\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\nPriority information is information that may enable other community members to avoid or : minimize similar undesirable events.

their mitigating controls. The list of threats types are aggregated from benchmark risk registers and mapped to mitigating controls to assist implementing entities during their risk assessment process.\n\nOverall, a number of security controls are needed to mitigate specific threat types given the complex nature of the threats. As such, threat types along with their corresponding mitigating controls are outlined in Table 9 below.\n\nTABLE 9: MAPPING OF THREATS TO CONTROLS\n\n[TABLE]\n       0                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2\nCATEGORY                                                                                                                                        THREATTYPE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          CONTROLNUMBERSOF MITIGATINGCONTROLS\n MALWARE Send Data to External Site/Entity BackdoororCommand and Control Disable or interfere with security controls System / Network Utilities RAMScraper M3.3.3;

As a recap, sector and national level controls are designed to overcome the silos created by a single-entity approach to IA, and hence create a stronger and more integrated approach for national information assurance. They serve as foundational elements for developing the sector and national views of IA by enabling the integration and analysis of information relating to security threats, risks and incidents, as well as the state of these Standards implementation and risk assessment outcomes.\n\nOverall, the UAE IA Standards provides a total of 15 sector and national level controls as outlined in Table 10 below.\n\nTABLE 10: SECTOR AND NATIONAL LEVEL CONTROLS\n\nCONTROL\n\nCONTROL\n\nNUMBER\n\nNAME\n\nM1\n\nSTRATEGY AND PLANNING\n\nM1.3\n\nORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION SECURITY\n\nM1.3.3\n\nContact with Authorities\n\nM1.3.4\n\nContact with Special Interest Groups\n\nM5\n\nCOMPLIANCE\n\nM5.1\n\nCOMPLIANCE POLICY\n\nM5.1.1\n\nCompliance Policy\n\nT3\n\nOPERATIONS MANAGEMENT\n\n73.6\n\nMONITORING\n\n13.6.1\n\nMonitoring Policy and Procedures\n\nAnnex E\n\nAnnex\n\n[TABLE]\n     0                                                         1\n    T4                                            COMMUNICATIONS\n  T4.4                            INFORMATIONEXCHANGESPROTECTION\nT4.4.1             Connectivity to Information Sharing Platforms\nT4.4.2 Information Released into Information Sharing Communities\n    T7  INFORMATIONSYSTEMSACQUISITION,DEVELOPMENT ANDMAINTENANCE\n  T7.4                                     CRYPTOGRAPHICCONTROLS\nT7.4.1                 Policy onthe Useof Cryptographic Controls\n  T7.8                                     SUPPLYCHAINMANAGEMENT\nT7.8.1                          Supply Chain Protection Strategy\nT7.8.2                                          Supplier Reviews\n    T8                     INFORMATIONSECURITYINCIDENTMANAGEMENT\n  T8.1               INFORMATIONSECURITYINCIDENTMANAGEMENTPOLICY\nT8.1.1             Information Security Incident Response Policy\n  T8.2  MANAGEMENTOFINFORMATIONSECURITYINCIDENTS ANDIMPROVEMENTS\nT8.2.2                                   Incident Classification\n  T8.3          INFORMATIONSECURITYEVENTSANDWEAKNESSES REPORTING\nT8.3.1                                     Situational Awareness\nT8.3.2                     Reporting Information Security Events\n[/TABLE]\n\nANNEX F\n\nTERMS AND DEFINITIONS\n\nTABLE 11: TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\n\n[TABLE]\n           TERM                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          DEFINITION\n          ASSET                                                                                                                                                                                    Anything that has value to the organization such as software, information, information systems.⁴\n          AUDIT Anindependent review of event logs and related activities performed to determine the adequacy of current security measures, to identify the degree of conformance with established policy or to develop recommendations for improvements to the security measures currently applied\n AUTHENTICATION                                                                                                                                             Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system.\n   AUTHENTICITY                                                                                                           Theproperty of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted; confidence in the validity of a transmission, a message, or messageoriginator.

      "content": "BACKGROUND\n\nThe adoption of Information Technology (IT) and electronic communication have greatly improved the efficiency and productivity of businesses and governments within the UAE, and facilitated collaboration of individuals within the nation and across the globe. Undoubtedly, IT and electronic communication have and will continue to play a pivotal role in the economic development of the UAE and the daily life of its citizens. Therefore, the UAE stands committed to the further development of its national IT and electronic communication infrastructure, as well as its cyberspace, to support economic development and provide an environment where the interests of its governments, businesses, and citizens can thrive.\n\nThe benefits of this technology adoption, however, come with a rapidly evolving set of cyber threats. These threats stem from a wide range of sources — including hacktivists, issue-motivated groups, and organized cybercrime syndicates — and represent national security concerns that can potentially disrupt critical national services and compromise critical information assets.\n\nMitigating cyber threats, and ensuring the development of a secure national information and communications infrastructure, and cyberspace, is a strategic priority for the UAE. To this end, NESA developed the UAE IA Standards as a critical element of the National Information Assurance Framework (NIAF) to provide requirements for elevating the level of IA across all implementing entities in the UAE.\n\nThe development of the UAE IA Standards is based on regional and global best practices including:\n\nISO/IEC 27001:2005 \"Information technology -Security techniques -Information security management systems -Requirements\",\n\nISO/IEC 27002:2005 \"Information technology -Security techniques -Code of practice for Information security management\",\n\nISO/IEC 27005:2005 \"Information technology -Security techniques -Information security risk management\"\n\nISO/IEC 27010:2012 \"Information technology -Security techniques -Information security management for inter-sector and inter-organizational communications\"\n\nISO/IEC 27032:2012 \"Information technology -Security techniques -Guidelines for cybersecurity\"\n\nNIST 800-53 Revision 4 \"Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations\"\n\nAbu Dhabi Information Security Standards Version 1 and Version 2, developed by Abu Dhabi Systems and Information Centre (ADSIC)\n\n. SANS 20 Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense Version 4.1\n\nMoreover the development was guided by key principles including:\n\nApplicability of the common IA requirements across industries , and applicability of the sector-specific IA requirements across entities within each CIIP sector\n\nSupport for the development of the entity, sector, and national-level views of cyber security, to address potential IA risks that emerge from the interconnectivity of entities and sectors\n\nSupport the performance management and the evolution of the controls in these standards based on measuring and sharing effective performance indicators, as well as contributions from key stakeholders to support the ongoing development and refinement of these Standards\n\nCompliance with these Standards will raise the level of national IA and help the UAE progress towards a more resilient national information and communication infrastructure, and cyberspace. All UAE government entities and other entities identified as critical' by NESA are obligated to implement these Standards. However, NESA highly recommends all entities in the UAE to adopt these Standards on a voluntary basis, as applicable, in order to participate in raising the nation minimum-security levels.\n\n+The process for NESA to designate an entity as \"critical\" is outlined in the UAE Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) Policy produced by NESA.",

In the face of this growing threat landscape, entities need to adopt practical measures to defend their critical information and information infrastructure against their most critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threats. To this end, a risk-based approach provides entities with a pragmatic mean to identify their most critical vulnerabilities that could expose them to risks, and develop corresponding appropriate treatments.\n\nAdopting a risk-based approach ensures that security controls are instituted in accordance with current risk assessments commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the impact that could result if critical information assets are compromised. The risk-based approach briefly outlined in these Standards summarizes a systematic methodology for identifying, estimating, evaluating, and treating identified entity-level risks.

While this common risk profile is widely applicable to implementing entities, NESA recognizes that entity risk profiles do differ based on their specific business and operational context. Given these differences, not all security controls provided in these Standards might be applicable to all entities. Therefore, these Standards require that the identification of the security controls be based on an entity risk assessment resulting in applicable security controls for the treatment of identified risks.\n\nPrior to performing the risk assessment process, an entity should consider all security controls to be applicable. However, an individual entity may exclude some security controls on the basis of the risk assessment outcomes, provided that adequate justification is submitted to NESA.\n\nMoreover, certain security controls included in these Standards represent requirements for instituting foundational IA capabilities within an entity, and as such, are considered \"Always Applicable\". Given their foundational role, the \"Always Applicable\" security controls shall be implemented by each relevant entity regardless of its risk assessment outcomes (refer to Annex 1 for a summary of \"Always Applicable\" controls).\n\nr=\n\n=~\n\n—~\n\n=~\n\n|—_\n\n|—_\n\n|=\n\nS|\n\nS|\n\nS|\n\nSE\n\nSE\n\nS-\n\n=\n\nIn summary, the concept of Applicability identifies the security controls that I are mandatory for implementation based on the list of applicable controls\n\nresulting from the entity risk assessment process, above and beyond the\n\nI \"Always Applicable\" controls.

This can be measured on an individual control basis, as well as the degree of compliance of an entity overall with the complete set of requirements. Increasing the level of compliance with the security controls provided in this Standard is the key to ensuring immediate and long lasting improvements of information assurance within the UAE and the overall success of the UAE's Information Assurance program.\n\nTo this end, NESA will ensure that an effective compliance monitoring scheme is in place which provides NESA with the visibility of the current status of compliance with this Standard and the activities needed for improving the overall security of the UAE's cyberspace.

The identification of risks related to external party access should take into iccount the following issues:\n\nThe information systems an external party is required to access\n\nThe type of access the external party will have to the information and information systems, e.g.\n\n-Physical access, e.g. to offices, computer rooms, filing cabinets\n\n2Logical access, e.g. to an entity's databases, information systems\n\n3Network connectivity between the entity's and the external party's network(s), e.g. permanent connection, remote access\n\n4Whether the access is taking place on-site or off-site\n\nThe controls necessary to protect information that is not intended to be accessible by external parties\n\nThe value and sensitivity of the information involved, and its criticality for business operations\n\nThe external party personnel involved in handling the entity's information\n\nHow the entity or personnel authorized to have access can be identified, the authorization verified, and how often this needs to be reconfirmed\n\nThe different means and controls employed by the external party when storing, processing, communicating, sharing and exchanging information\n\nThe impact of access not being available to the external party when required, and the external party entering or receiving inaccurate or misleading information\n\nPractices and procedures to deal with information security incidents and potential damages, and the terms and conditions for the continuation of external party access in the case of an information security incident\n\nLegal and regulatory requirements and other contractual obligations relevant to the external party that should be taken into account\n\nHow the interests of any other stakeholders may be affected by the arrangements\n\nccess by external parties to the entity's information should not be provided until the appropriate 'ontrols have been implemented and, where feasible, a contract has been signed defining the erms and conditions for the connection or access and the working arrangement. Generally, all curity requirements resulting from work with external parties or internal controls should be eflected by the agreement with the external party. It should be ensured that the external party s aware of their obligations, and accepts the responsibilities and liabilities involved in accessing, rocessing, communicating, or managing the entity's information and information systems.\n\n|\n\n3\n\n:\n\n©\n\n3\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n|\n\n:\n\n[TABLE]\n| 0           | 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|:------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| M1.3.6      | ADDRESSING SECURITYWHEN DEALINGWITH CUSTOMERS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| CONTROL     | The entity shall address all identified security requirements before giving customers access to the entity's information or assets.                                                                                                                                              |\n| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) make sure that any customer accessing entity information and information systems are compliant with the entity's information security policy and security requirements 2) monitor any customer access and verify compliance to agreed access control policy |\n[/TABLE]\n\nlowing terms should be considered to address security prior to giving customers access 0 any of the entity's assets (depending on the type and extent of access given, not allofthem might apply):",

Damage to an asset that is important for the business is much likelier to cause severe consequences than an asset that is ot as important. Based on the business use of the asset, the consequences for a loss of the 'ollowing needs to be assessed:\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY — This means the information asset is only accessible to those authorized to access it\n\nINTEGRITY — This means the information asset has not been modified in any unauthorized way\n\n. AVAILABILITY — This means the information asset is available, when needed\n\no make the results of this assessment comparable, scales should be used, which should have een defined in the Information Security Risk Management Policy (see M2.1.1 above).\n\nhe assessment of these consequences should be done together with the business users of he information assets, as these can give important input into the process because they are ware of the security requirements for their assets. This can be done by interviews and/or uestionnaires, but it is important to ensure that the business users understand what is asked rom them.\n\ns aresult, each asset should have identified consequences of losses of confidentiality, integrity\n\n!\n\ni\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n!\n\n:\n\n:\n\n;\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:",

If the entity uses external resources, care hould be taken to ensure that the external resource have enough knowledge of the entity to uccessfully conduct the audit.\n\nnother important aspect of the internal audit is the entity's reaction to its results. The results f the internal audits should be considered by the Information Security Committee (refer to 1.1.2), and it should be ensured that all findings of the audit are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n:\n\n:\n\n!\n\nH\n\ni\n\n:\n\n:\n\n!\n\nH\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\nH\n\n:\n\n:\n\n[TABLE]\n| 0                                   | 1                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|:------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| M6.3                                | IMPROVEMENT                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| OBJECTIVE                           | Tocorrect nonconformities with this Standard andtocontinually improve the information security programinplace                                                               |\n| PERFORMANCE INDICATOR               | Number of all non-conformities that have been detected and not resolved within the time frame planned                                                                       |\n| AUTOMATION GUIDANCE                 | Not applicable                                                                                                                                                              |\n| RELEVANT THREATSAND VULNERABILITIES | • Non-compliance with the controls in this Standard • Repeated incidents and inappropriate action to information security problems • Noimprovements to information security |\n[/TABLE]",

Theentity could useatooltoautomatethefollowingprocesses: • Tracking of information asset inventory, • Assignmentofinformation assets ownership • Defining the right use of information assets Some entities maintain asset inventories using specific large-scale commercial products dedicated to the task, or they use free solutions to track and then sweep the network periodically for new assets connected to it. In particular, when entities acquire new systems, they record the owner andfeaturesofeachnewasset,includingitsnetworkinterfaceMediaAccess Control (MAC) address and location.

Whenever it is difficult to segregate, other controls uch as monitoring of activities, audit trails and management supervision should be considered.\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\nH\n\n:\n\nTBRORE\n\n[TABLE]\n| 0           | 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|:------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| T3.2.5      | SEPARATIONOF DEVELOPMENT, TESTAND OPERATIONAL FACILITIES PRIORITY APPLICABILITY                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| CONTROL     | The entity shall separate development, test, and operational environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| SUB-CONTROL | 1) Identify the appropriate level of separation between operational, test, and development environments 2) Define the rules for transferring software and systems from one environment to another 3) Ensure the rules are integrated into the system / software development lifecycle |\n[/TABLE]\n\n: The level of separation between operational, test, and development environments that is. necessary to prevent operational problems should be identified and appropriate controls | H : implemented.

AUTOMATION GUIDANCE                 | Relying on policy and user action to keep anti-malware tools up to date has been widely discredited, as many users have not proven capable of consistently handling this task. To ensure anti-virus signatures are up to date, entities use automation. They use the built-in administrative features of enterprise endpoint security suites to verify that anti-virus, anti-spyware, and host-based IDS featuresareactiveoneverymanagedsystem.Theyrun automated assessments daily and review the results to find and mitigate systems that have deactivated such protections, as well as systems that do not have the latest malware definitions. Some entities deploy free or commercial honeypot and tarpit tools to identify attackers in their environment. Security personnel should continuously monitor honeypots and tarpits to determine whether traffic is directed to them and account logins are attempted. When they identify such events, these personnel should gather the source address from which this traffic originates and other details associated with the attack for follow-on investigation. |\n|

capabilities. Such logging should be activated, with logs sent to centralized logging servers. Firewalls, proxies, and remote access systems (VPN, dial-up, etc.) should all be configured for verbose logging, storing all the information available for logging in the event a follow- up investigation is required. Furthermore, operating systems, especially those of servers, should be configured to create access control logs when a user attempts to access resources without the appropriate privileges. To evaluate whether such logging is in place, an entity should periodically scan through its logs and compare them with the asset inventory in order to ensure that each managed item actively connected to the network is periodically generating logs. Analytical programs such as SIM/SEM solutions for reviewing logs can provide value, but the capabilities employed to analyze audit logs are quite extensive, including, importantly, evenjust a cursory examination by a person. Actual correlation tools can make audit logs far more useful for subsequent manual inspection. Such tools can be quite helpful in identifying subtle attacks. However, these tools are neither a panacea nor a replacement for skilled information security personnel and system administrators. Even with automated log analysis tools, human expertise and intuition are often required to identify and understand attacks. |\n| RELEVANT THREATSAND VULNERABILITIES | • Unauthorized access •

Recently added features in these port scanners are being used to determine the changes in services offered by scanned machinesonthenetworksincethepreviousscan,helpingsecuritypersonnel identify differences over time. |\n| RELEVANT THREATSAND VULNERABILITIES | • Abuse of system access/privileges • Eavesdropping / Packet Sniffing • Denial of Service(DOS)orDDOS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n[/TABLE]\n\ni\n\n:\n\n:\n\nH\n\n:\n\n:\n\ni\n\n:\n\n[TABLE]\n| 0           | 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|:------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| T4.5.1      | NETWORK CONTROLS PRIORITY P1 APPLICABILITY BASEDONRISK ASSESSMENT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| CONTROL     | The entity shall ensure that all networks are adequately managed, controlled, and protected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Identify all network componentsandinterconnectivitybetweenthem 2) Document and maintain network diagram that includes all network components as well as their connections 3) Perform a risk assessment on individual network components and the network as a whole to identify vulnerabilities requiring action 4) Identify and implement specific network controls needed to mitigate the vulnerabilities identified 5) Continually monitor the in-place controls for efficiency and effectiveness |\n[/TABLE]",

A graduated set of controls can be applied n different logical network domains to further segregate the network security environments, .g. publicly accessible systems, internal networks, and critical assets. The domains should e defined based on a risk assessment and the different security requirements within each of he domains.\n\nuch a network perimeter can be implemented by installing a secure gateway between the wo networks to be interconnected to control access and information flow between the two lomains. This gateway should be configured to filter traffic between these domains and to block nauthorized access in accordance with the entity's access control policy. An example of this ype of gateway is what is commonly referred to as a firewall. Another method of segregating eparate logical domains is to restrict network access by using virtual private networks for user roups within the entity.\n\nletworks can also be segregated using the network device functionality, e.g. IP switching. eparate domains can then be implemented by controlling the network data flows using the 'outing/switching capabilities, such as access control lists.\n\nhe criteria for segregation of networks into domains should be based on the access control jolicy and access requirements, and also take account of the relative cost and performance mpact of incorporating suitable network routing or gateway technology.\n\nn addition, segregation of networks should be based on the value and classification of nformation stored or processed in the network, levels of trust, or lines of business, in order to reduce the total impact of a service disruption.\n\n:\n\ni\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n;\n\n:\n\n:\n\nH\n\ni\n\n:\n\n:\n\n;\n\n:\n\ni\n\n;\n\n:\n\n:\n\ni\n\n:\n\n[TABLE]\n| 0           | 1                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|:------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| T4.5.4      | SECURITYOF WIRELESS NETWORKS PRIORITY APPLICABILITY BASEDONRISK ASSESSMENT                                                                                                             |\n| CONTROL     | The entity shall ensure that all wireless networks are adequately secured.                                                                                                             |\n|             | The entity shall: 1) Undertake and document a site survey to determine the optimal physical locations to avoid stray signal leaking too far outside of the entity's physical perimeter |\n| SUB-CONTROL | 2) Identify criteria for grouping information services, users, and information systems into different groups that facilitate segregation on wireless networks                          |\n[/TABLE]",

AUTOMATION GUIDANCE                 | Built-in operating system features can extract lists of accounts with super-user privileges, both locally on individual systems and on overall domain controllers. To verify that users with high-privileged accounts do not use such accounts for day-to-day web surfing and e-mail reading, security personnel should periodically gather a list of running processes to determine whether any browsers or e-mail readers are running with high privileges. Such information gathering can be scripted, with short shell scripts searching for a dozen or more different browsers, e-mail readers, and document editing programs running with high privileges on machines. Some legitimate system administration activity may require the execution of such programs over the short term, but long-term or frequent use of such programs with administrative privileges could indicate that an administrator is not adhering to this control. Monitoring tools can provide such information. |\n| RELEVANT THREATSAND VULNERABILITIES | • Abuse of system access/privileges • Backdoor or CommandandControl • Disable or interfere with security controls • Tampering in network utilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n| 0           | 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|:------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| T5.5.1      | SECURELOG-ON PROCEDURES PRIORITY APPLICABILITY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| CONTROL     | The entity shall control access to systems and applications using a secure log-on and log-off procedure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Identify the systems, applications and services that require user authentication 2) Classify the identified systems, application and services based onthe level of protection needed 3) Establish the appropriate log-on and log-off procedures to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access |\n[/TABLE]",

            | With asset inventory assembled, manyentities usetools to pull information from network assets such as switches and routers regarding the machines connected to the network. Using securely authenticated and encrypted network management protocols, tools can retrieve MAC addresses and other information from network devices that can be reconciled with the entity'sassetinventoryofservers,workstations,laptops,andotherdevices. Once MAC addresses are confirmed, switches should implement 802.1x and NAC to only allow authorized systems that are properly configured to connect to the network. Going further, effective entities configure free or commercial network scanning tools to perform network sweeps on a regular basis, sending a variety of different packet types to identify devices connected to the network. Before such scanning can take place, entities should verify that they have adequate bandwidth for such periodic scans by consulting load history and capacities for their networks. In conducting inventory scans, scanning tools could send traditional ping packets (ICMP Echo Request) looking for ping responses to identify a system at a given IP address.

Examples of checks that can be incorporated include the following: i\n\nSession or batch controls, to reconcile data file balances after transaction updates\n\nBalancing controls, to check opening balances against previous closing balances, namely\n\n1Run-to-run controls\n\n2File update totals\n\n3Program-to-program controls\n\nValidation of system-generated input data\n\nChecks on the integrity, authenticity or any other security feature of data or software downloaded, or uploaded, between central and remote computers\n\nHash totals of records and files\n\nChecks to ensure that

AUTOMATION GUIDANCE   | A large number of vulnerability scanning tools are available to evaluate the security configuration of systems. Some entities have also found commercial services using remotely managed scanning appliances to be effective. To help standardize the definitions of discovered vulnerabilities in multiple departments of an entity or even across entities it is preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that measure security flaws and map them to vulnerabilities and issues categorized using one or more of the following industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration, and platform classification schemesandlanguages:CVE,CCE,OVAL,CPE,CVSS,and/orXCCDF. Advancedvulnerabilityscanningtoolscanbeconfiguredwithusercredentials to log in to scanned systems and perform more comprehensive scans than can be achieved without login credentials. The frequency of scanning activities, however, should increase as the diversity of an entity's systems increases to account for the varying patch cycles of eachvendor. In addition to the scanning tools that check for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across the network, various free and commercial tools can evaluate security settings and configurations of local machines on which they are installed. Such tools can provide fine-grained insight into unauthorized changes in configuration or the inadvertent introduction of security weaknessesbyadministrators. Effective entities link their vulnerability scanners with problem-ticketing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n| 0               | 1   | 2                                            |\n|:----------------|:----|:---------------------------------------------|\n| RELEVANT        | •   | Exploitation of known system vulnerabilities |\n| THREATSAND      | •   | Undetected system vulnerabilities            |\n| VULNERABILITIES | •   | Unpatched applications                       |\n[/TABLE]\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\ni\n\n:\n\nHy\n\n[TABLE]\n| 0           | 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|:------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| T7.7.1      | CONTROLOF TECHNICAL VULNERABILITIES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| CONTROL     | The entity shall obtain and act upon information about technical vulnerabilities of information systems being used                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Identify vulnerabilities in new systems and applications and define a remediation plan before placing them in a production environment 2) Test, review, check, and verify the presence of vulnerabilities in production systems throughout the development life-cycle, preferably by the use of automated testing tools 3) Perform a Cost-Benefit-Analysis (CBA) for vulnerabilities to |\n[/TABLE]",

Entities : should participate in sector, national, and international exercises to further test incident response capabilities.\n\n:\n\n:\n\n[TABLE]\n| 0           | 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|:------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| T8.2.6      | INCIDENT RESPONSE ASSISTANCE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| CONTROL     | The entity shall provide an incident response support resource to offer advice and assistance in case of an incident.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Develop testing procedures and cases to validate effectiveness and usefulness of its incident response capability 2) Establish expected test results 3) Conduct incident response capability testing and compare outcome to the expected results to identify gaps and weaknesses for remediation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n:\n\n\"The entity should provide an incident response support resources as part ofits incident response : capability to provide advice and assistance to users of the information system during steady : state operation and incidents for the detection, handling and reporting of security incidents.\n\n|\n\nThe entity should provide an incident response support resources in different forms to reach : the widest audience, such as:\n\n+ — Informative website\n\n:\n\nb+ Online knowledge base\n\n+ Callcenter, etc.\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\nMoreover, the entity should coordinate with external providers (for example, national CERT) through its incident response capability for help in the detection and handling of incidents within the entity.\n\n|\n\ni\n\n|\n\n:\n\n[TABLE]\n| T8.2.7      | INFORMATION SECURITY INCIDENT DOCUMENTATION PRIORITY APPLICABILITY BASEDONRISK ASSESSMENT                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|:------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CONTROL     | The entity shall document all information security incidents.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Identify the relevant data to be collected before, during and after an information security incident takes place 2) Collect and document relevant data related to all security incidents 3) Protect the information security incident documentation |\n[/TABLE]\n\ni\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\ni\n\nDocumenting information security incidents includes, for example, maintaining records about each incident, the status of the incident, and other pertinent information necessary for forensics, evaluating incident details, trends, and handling.

For an automated identification of weaknesses, a large number of vulnerability scanning tools are available. Some enterprises have also found commercial services using remotely managed scanning appliances to be effective. To help standardize the definitions of discovered vulnerabilities in multiple departments of an entity or evenacross entities, it is preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that measure security flaws and map them to vulnerabilities and issues categorized using one or more of the following industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration, and platform classification schemes and languages: CVE, CCE, OVAL, CPE, CVSS, and/or XCCDF. Advanced vulnerability scanning tools can be configured with user credentials to log in to scanned systems and perform more comprehensivescansthancanbeachievedwithoutlogincredentials.The frequency of scanning activities, however, should increase as the diversity of an entity's systems increases to account for the varying patch cycles of each vendor. Also, event log collectors and incident management systems should be considered. These technologies provide log collection, normalization, correlation and analysis: they can be very helpful both to detect incidents in their early stages and to investigate incidents. |\n| RELEVANT THREATSAND VULNERABILITIES | • Leakage of reported weaknesses • Unsuitable reporting procedures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n| 0                                                 | 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|:--------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| T8.3.1                                            | SITUATIONAL AWARENESS PRIORITY APPLICABILITY BASEDONRISK ASSESSMENT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| CONTROL                                           | The entity shall develop a situational awareness culture by participating in the information sharing community and obtaining cyber security information from various sources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| SUB-CONTROL                                       | The entity shall: 1) Identify priority information and share it internally to build the entity context 2) For the sector context, identify and share priority information that is relevant to entities in the same sector to build the sector context 3) For the national context, identify and share priority information that is relevant across all sectors to build the national context |\n| IMPLEMENTATIONGUIDANCE(FORINFORMATIONPURPOSEONLY) | IMPLEMENTATIONGUIDANCE(FORINFORMATIONPURPOSEONLY)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n[/TABLE]\n\n:\n\n:\n\n©\n\n:\n\n:\n\n_\n\n}\n\ni\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\nPriority information is information that may enable other community members to avoid or : minimize similar undesirable events.

As a recap, sector and national level controls are designed to overcome the silos created by a single-entity approach to IA, and hence create a stronger and more integrated approach for national information assurance. They serve as foundational elements for developing the sector and national views of IA by enabling the integration and analysis of information relating to security threats, risks and incidents, as well as the state of these Standards implementation and risk assessment outcomes.\n\nOverall, the UAE IA Standards provides a total of 15 sector and national level controls as outlined in Table 10 below.",
