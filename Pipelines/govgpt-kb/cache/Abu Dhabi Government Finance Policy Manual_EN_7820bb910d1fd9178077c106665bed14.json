Revenue and Receivables\n\n5.1 Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to provide directives to Abu Dhabi Government Entities for accurate and timely recording of Revenue and Receivables. This policy ensures alignment of consistent revenue classification and measurement across the Government Entities. Additionally, the policy provides directives to the Government Entities relating to loss allowances for overdue receivables and the collection and dunning process.\n\n5.2 Scope\n\nThis policy is issued pursuant Article (8) of Law No. (1) of 2017 and covers    revenues arising from binding and non-binding arrangement transactions that the Government Entity undertakes in its normal course of business. This policy details revenue categories, and their respective measurements and recording. Furthermore, the policy provides directives to the Government Entity for recording receivables, provisions and write offs (if any).\n\nThe policy shall be read in conjunction with:\n\n· Law No. (1) of 2017 regarding the financial system of Abu Dhabi Government and its related amendments\n\n· Government of Abu Dhabi Accounting Policy Manual\n\n· IPSAS 32 - Service Concessions Arrangements\n\n· IPSAS 47 - Revenue (effective 1 January 2026 to replace IPSAS 9, IPSAS 11 and IPSAS 23)\n\n· IPSAS 41 - Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2023 to replace IPSAS 29)\n\n· Other related IPSAS accounting standards\n\nAlignment on Exchange and Non-Exchange transactions (preface to change in standard adoption for revenue treatment)\n\nTransactions carried out by Government Entities during their ordinary course of business result in various revenues streams that are currently classified as revenue from Exchange Transactions or Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions.\n\nThe relevant applicable standards at the time of drafting this policy document (IPSAS 9 and IPSAS 23) classify revenue from Exchange / Non-Exchange Transaction as transactions in which the Government Entity receives consideration in the form of cash, goods, services, use of assets or amortization of liabilities in exchange for the provision of goods and services of approximately equal / unequal value to the public or another entity respectively.\n\nThis policy has been prepared in accordance with the updated IPSAS 47 standard to reflect a \"single source revenue accounting' guidance. IPSAS 47 requires the Government Entity to determine whether its revenue arises from a transaction with a binding arrangement or from transactions without a binding arrangement .\n\nIPSAS 47 guides the Government Entity to identify the enforceable rights and enforceable obligations based on the terms of the arrangement to assist classification of such transactions as revenue from binding or non-binding arrangements. A binding arrangement under IPSAS 47 is broader than a 'contract' and allows for leeway where a Government Entity cannot enter into legal contracts (with\n\nenforceability through legal means) but does enter into arrangements that are in substance the same as a contract.\n\nWhile IPSAS 9 and 23 focus on value equivalence comparison, where equivalent value transactions are exchange transactions and non-equivalent value transactions are non-exchange transactions, IPSAS 47 focuses on terms of the arrangements where transactions with both enforceable rights and obligations are binding arrangements and transactions without both or either, are non-binding arrangements. The following table compares approximates an alignment between the existing standards and IPSAS 47:\n\nRevenue Definitions in the Abu Dhabi Ecosystem\n\nRevenue from transactions with binding arrangements:\n\nRevenue from transactions arising from binding arrangements undertaken by the Government Entity, where the arrangement confers both, rights and obligations, enforceable through legal or equivalent means on the parties to the arrangement, can be classified under one or more of the following, based on the Government Entity's respective revenue stream(s):\n\n· Sales of Goods\n\n· Rendering Services\n\n· Interests\n\n· Royalties (including service concession agreements)\n\n· Dividends\n\nRevenue for transactions without binding arrangements:\n\nRevenue from transactions arising from non-binding arrangements undertaken by the Government Entity, where the Government Entity does not have both an enforceable right and an enforceable obligation, but may have one, can be classified under one or more of the following based on the Government Entity's respective revenue stream(s):\n\nService in -kind\n\nServices provided by individuals to Government Entities in a non-exchange transaction (such as volunteering).\n\n5.3 General Policies for Revenue Management\n\nThis section provides the user of this policy directives on the revenue policies related to identification and recording of revenues from binding and non-binding arrangement transactions in a timely manner.\n\n5.3.1 The Government Entity shall classify all revenue streams in its normal course of business according to the nature of transaction as binding or non-binding arrangement to determine the appropriate recognition and measurement in accordance with IPSAS 47.\n\n5.3.2 The Government Entity shall ensure accurate revenue transactions recognition in accordance with revenue streams classification and in accordance with IPSAS 47.\n\n5.3.3 Revenue from non-binding arrangements transactions shall be recorded at the amount of their transaction considerations.

IPSAS 47 requires the Government Entity to determine whether its revenue arises from a transaction with a binding arrangement or from transactions without a binding arrangement .\n\nIPSAS 47 guides the Government Entity to identify the enforceable rights and enforceable obligations based on the terms of the arrangement to assist classification of such transactions as revenue from binding or non-binding arrangements. A binding arrangement under IPSAS 47 is broader than a 'contract' and allows for leeway where a Government Entity cannot enter into legal contracts (with\n\nenforceability through legal means) but does enter into arrangements that are in substance the same as a contract.\n\nWhile IPSAS 9 and 23 focus on value equivalence comparison, where equivalent value transactions are exchange transactions and non-equivalent value transactions are non-exchange transactions, IPSAS 47 focuses on terms of the arrangements where transactions with both enforceable rights and obligations are binding arrangements and transactions without both or either, are non-binding arrangements.
