Accordingly, the following is recommended: • Write the Gregorian and Hijri months in the form of words. • Use a space as a separator between the day, month, and year, not the horizontal hyphen \"-\" or the forward slash \"/\". Express the day with two digits and the year with four digits. 15/5/2024 1445/9/29 2-6-24 15 May 2024 29 Ramadan 1445 02 June 2024\n[/TABLE]\n\nTime\n\n[TABLE]\n                                                                                                      Common Mistake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Correct Rule                                                                                                                                                     Wrong Example                                                                                                                                         Correct Example\n                                               Express the hours using a single number, without showing the minutes.
