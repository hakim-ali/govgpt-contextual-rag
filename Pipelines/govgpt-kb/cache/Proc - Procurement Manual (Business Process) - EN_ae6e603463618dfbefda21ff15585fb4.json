  "full_text": "Procurement Manual (Business Processes) Issued pursuant to the Abu Dhabi Procurement Standards\n\nIssued By\n\nH.E. Ali Rashed Al Ketbi\n\nChairman, Department of Government Support - Abu Dhabi\n\nList of Content\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n1. Introduction\n\n1.1 Introduction to the Procurement Manual\n\n1.1.1 Purpose of the Procurement Manual\n\nThe  Procurement  Manual  provides  operational  procedures  to  the  Procurement  practitioners.  It reinforces the Procurement Standards, the Procurement Charter, and the Procurement Delegation of Authority (PDoA), giving a more detailed explanation of their application.\n\n1.1.2 Scope of the Procurement Manual\n\nThe Procurement Manual applies to all procurement activities conducted by the government Entities and  the  Government  Procurement  Office  (GPO).  The  Executive  Council  (EC),  or  a  relevant  body authorised by the EC, may exclude an Entity from the application of the Procurement Manual. The Procurement  Manual  covers  all  relevant  procurement  processes  and  serves  as  the  operational framework.\n\n1.1.2.(I) List of Exemptions\n\nThe Procurement Manual does not apply to:\n\na) Staff salaries and benefits\n\nb) Direct employment contracts or the engagement of individual experts which cannot be subject to tender\n\nc) General  and  administration  expenses  for  non-predefined  technical  specifications,  electricity, water, utilities, accommodation rentals provided to the employees and governed by the housing policies,  professional  and  nonprofessional  bodies'  subscriptions,  fee  paid  to  organisers  of conferences/exhibitions\n\nd) Agreements  among  government  Entities  or  with  international  professional  bodies  for  the purposes of research/collaboration/promotions\n\ne) Sponsorships and grants\n\nf) Purchase of artworks, artifacts, and associated ancillary expenses\n\ng) Copyrights license fees except where there is a contractual obligation to purchase goods, services or projects\n\nh) Reimbursement of adhoc expenses incurred during travel (below Petty Cash threshold).\n\ni) Mandatory or Regulatory fees (such as court fees, duties and taxes, bank fees etc.)\n\nj) Any other exceptions approved by the Executive Council (EC)\n\n1.1.3 Structure of the Manual\n\nThe structure of the Procurement Manual is aligned to the Procurement Capability Model (refer to Figure 1.3.1 ):\n\na) Level 1 - Procurement capabilities are classified into Strategic, Tactical, Operational, and Support capabilities.\n\nb) Level 2 - Each procurement capability includes one or more procurement process group.\n\nc) Level 3 - Each procurement process group consists of procurement processes.\n\nImportant  Note:  All  procurement  processes  must  be  executed  in  line  with  the  Procurement Standards.\n\nProcurement process groups are covered in the manual as per the following structure:\n\n1. Overview\n\n2. Details of level 3 Processes\n\ni. Scope and Purpose\n\nii. Procedures and Methodologies\n\niii. Roles and Responsibilities\n\n3. Work Aids -Forms and Documents\n\n4. RACI Matrix\n\nWork  Aids -Forms  and  Documents section  is  only  provided  where  applicable.  Best  practice templates of these work aids are issued and maintained by the GPO. Entities may either use the templates provided by the GPO, or use another approved template covering required elements.\n\nProcurement process maps, lists of tables and figures, and glossary of terms and definitions are covered in Appendix.\n\nProcurement practitioners reading this manual should consider the following points:\n\na) Key roles and functions are covered in the Procurement Manual in bold Italic (e.g., Sourcing Specialist, Tendering Committee, Contract Administrator etc.).\n\nb) Key business terms and keywords are covered in the Procurement Manual in Upper Case and defined in the Glossary (e.g., Negotiations Team, Common Category, Entity Specific Category, etc.).\n\nc) Key  documents  a re  covered  in  the  Procurement  Manual  in  'single  quotes'  (e.g.,  'Supplier Segmentation Report', 'Sourcing Strategy', 'Category Strategy', etc.).\n\nd) Supplier  Master  Data  Management  process  group  is  executed  entirely  by  Government Procurement Office (GPO) using ' SAP Ariba ' . For this process group, key SAP Ariba terms, roles, statuses,  templates,  etc.  are  covered  in  the  Procurement  Manual  in  'double  quotes'  (e.g., 'Supplier Manager', 'General Registration Questionnaire' etc.).\n\ne) Matters critical from a feasibility or compliance perspective are highlighted as Important Note (e.g., Important  Note:  All  Procurement  processes  must  be  executed  in  line  with  the Procurement Standards ).\n\nf) Reference to other documents or sections within the Procurement Manual are highlighted as underlined  italics (e.g.,  Please  refer  to Section  2.5.3.(II) for  the  details  of  the  'Supplier Development and Collaboration' processes).\n\n1.2 Procurement Operating Model\n\nThe Procurement consists  of  the  Government Procurement Office (GPO) and Entity Procurement .  The Procurement Operating Model provides mandate, empowerment, and responsibilities of the Government Procurement Office (GPO) and Entity Procurement .\n\nFigure 1.2.1 Procurement Capability Model\n\nThe Government Procurement Office (GPO) is established to fulfil the following objectives:\n\na) Acting on behalf of the Entities to consolidate demand for achieving economies of scale. The GPO is authorized to manage and execute sourcing for Common Categories.\n\nb) Providing  shared  services  such  as  Supplier  Registration,  Item  Master  Management,  User  Master Management, and Training.\n\nc) Maintaining the Procurement Framework ensuring a standardized and efficient way of working of the Procurement .\n\nd) Developing and operating the information technology platform for government procurement (eGate).\n\ne) Running  market  development  initiatives  and  managing  partnerships  with  the  private  sector  in coordination with the relevant authorities.\n\nEntity Procurement is  responsible for procurement of the Entity-Specific Categories including sourcing, contracting, ordering, and managing Supplier performance. The Entity Procurement utilizes  the  shared services provided by the GPO.\n\nThe  GPO  engages  stakeholders  from  the  Entities  and  dedicated Finance , Legal or  other  resources  as needed  for  procuring  Common  Categories.  The  Entity Procurement engages End-Users and  dedicated Finance , Legal or other resources for procuring Entity-Specific Categories.\n\n1.2.1 Category Classification\n\nClassification  of  a  category  as  a  Common  Category  or  an  Entity-Specific  Category  depends  on  the category spend value and its commonality across Entities. A category that is procured by five or more Entities may be considered as a Common Category.\n\nFigure 1.2.2 Common vs. Entity Specific Categories\n\n1.2.2 Category Taxonomy\n\nCategory  taxonomy  refers  to  a  hierarchical  assignment  of  goods/services.  In  line  with  global  best practices, UNSPSC (United Nations Standard Products and Services Code) taxonomy is recommended to be adopted by GPO and Entity Procurement .    UNSPSC is a four-level taxonomy with each record represented with an eight-digit number and unique name, illustrated below:\n\nFigure 1.2.3 UNSPSC Categorizations\n\nThe four primary levels of the UNSPSC are Segment, Family, Class, and Commodity. Each level is identified by two digits, that constitute together an overall eight-digit code.\n\nStandard categorization of goods/services/projects may be used for:\n\na) Consolidation of demand requirements\n\nb) Development of 'Category Strategy'\n\nc) Segmentation of Suppliers , and\n\nd) Identification of Supplier risk profiles.\n\nBest practice templates provided for these processes already include UNSPSC taxonomy. All Abu Dhabi  DED  activities  are  mapped  to  Level  2  UNSPSC  categories. A  comprehensive  'DED -UNSPSC Mapping Report' is provided in Section 2.2.3 for reference.\n\n1.3 Procurement Capability Model\n\nThe Procurement Capability Model comprises of four types of procurement capabilities: Strategic, Tactical, Operational, and Support as illustrated below:\n\nFigure 1.3.1 Procurement Capability Model\n\n1.3.1 Strategic Procurement Capability (Level 1)\n\na) Procurement Strategy (Level 2) process group includes procedures to develop strategy for the Procurement function in line with the overall Entity strategy.\n\nb) Demand and  Category  Management  (Level  2) process  group includes  procedures  to  develop 'Category Strategy' to deliver value and drive cost savings, and 'Procurement Plan' to bridge the demand-supply gap.\n\n1.3.2 Tactical Procurement Capability (Level 1)\n\na) Source to Contract (Level 2) process group includes procedures to conduct sourcing and award Suppliers.\n\nb) Contract  Lifecycle  Management  (Level  2) process  group includes  procedures  to  create  and manage contracts.\n\nc) Supplier  performance  and  Relationship  Management  (Level  2) process  group includes  the procedures to segment Suppliers, manage relationships with selected Suppliers , and evaluate and manage performance of Suppliers.\n\n1.3.3 Operational Procurement Capability (Level 1)\n\na) Requisition to Pay (Level 2) process group includes procedures to create Purchase Requisition (PR), create Purchase Order (PO), receive goods/services, create Goods/Services/Project Receipt, and reconcile invoice.\n\n1.3.4 Supporting Capability (Level 1)\n\na) Risk  and  Regulation  (Level  2) process  group includes  procedures  to  conduct  risk  profiling  for Suppliers , identify and mitigate procurement risks, and implement regulatory changes.\n\nb) Supplier  Master  Data  Management  (Level  2) process  group includes  procedures  to  register, qualify, disqualify, deactivate, and reactivate Suppliers .\n\nc) Item Master Data Management (Level 2) process group includes procedures to add, modify, and remove goods/services/projects from the master database.\n\nd) User Master Data Management (Level 2) process group includes procedures to add, modify, and delete users in User Master Data.\n\n1.4 Procurement Benefits\n\nThis section provides the details regarding:\n\na) Definition of Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits\n\nb) General principles that apply to Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits\n\nc) Methodologies to calculate the Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits\n\n1.4.1 Definitions\n\n1. Baseline Spend\n\nBaseline  Spend  is  the  foundation  of  the  Procurement  Benefits  calculation.  It  is  the  value  of addressable spend against which any benefit is measured. Establishing a baseline is the first step in the Procurement Benefits calculations process.\n\n2. Classification of Procurement Benefits\n\nProcurement Benefits can be classified into Cost Reduction, Cost Avoidance, and Cash Impact. Details of the same are provided below:\n\nTable 1.4.1 Procurement Benefits Classification\n\n1.4.2 General Principles\n\nFollowing general principles apply to the calculation of Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits:\n\n1. Baseline principles\n\ni. An agreed baseline is required for Procurement Benefits calculations and must be signed-off by the relevant stakeholders from the End-User , the Finance and the Procurement .\n\nii. Baseline could be historic actuals (e.g., prior year spend, budgeted spend, etc.).\n\niii. The baseline must be supported by one or multiple data sets, such as  Accounts Payable (AP) data, Purchase Orders (PO) data, Contracts data, etc.\n\niv. An appropriate method to calculate the Baseline Spend should be determined for each type of procurement benefit.\n\n2. Procurement Benefits calculation principles\n\ni. Procurement Benefits can be calculated after acceptance of a final, binding offer from one or more Supplier(s) and the acknowledgment of offer conditions (with written confirmation, Letter of Intent, contract amendment, etc.).\n\nii. Benefits implementation  costs (one-time investments) are excluded from  the benefits calculation.\n\n1.4.3 Calculation Methodologies\n\n1. Baseline Spend\n\nBaseline Spend is based on two parameters and is calculated as following:\n\nBaseline Spend = Total Volume * Baseline Unit Price\n\nTotal volume may be known or unknown. However, two methods can be used for calculations to estimate volume, as detailed:\n\nTable 1.4.2 Volume Estimation Methodologies\n\nBaseline unit price may be estimated using one of the following methodologies:\n\ni. Historic price baseline\n\nHistoric price baseline is relevant when the goods/services/projects were purchased previously (in last year). Below are the details of various methods to create a historic price baseline:\n\nTable 1.4.3 Historic Baseline Price Calculation Methodologies\n\nii. Comparable price baseline\n\nIf a certain goods/service has not been purchased previously, historic price baseline cannot be established. In such cases, the baseline price can be estimated using comparable goods/services/projects  (identical  or  similar  specifications)  where  the  price  is  known.  (e.g., estimating  the  baseline  price  for  a  car  rental  service  by  comparing  it  with  similar  services previously purchased by another Entity).\n\niii. New price baseline\n\nIf  neither  a  historic  nor  a  comparable  baseline  can  be  established,  a  new  baseline  can  be developed based on the initial RFI or RFP/RFQ responses provided by the Suppliers . The baseline price  will  be  calculated  as  an  average  of  the  approved  initial  quotes.  Any  price  reductions received through follow-on RFP/ auction/negotiation is considered as benefits.\n\n2. Procurement Benefits\n\nAs illustrated in Table 1.4.1 , Procurement Benefits are classified into three buckets:\n\ni. Cost Savings\n\nFollowing are the various Cost Savings scenarios:\n\na. Standard Method (last paid price -new price)\n\nThis  method  is  used  when  the  savings  result  from  the  difference  between  baseline  and negotiated price. For example, when Suppliers are changed or when similar goods/services/projects  are  bundled,  resulting  in  a  better  price  per  item.  Savings  in  this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (baseline price -negotiated price) * volume\n\nb. Free of charges Extra\n\nThese are the savings realized when contracts negotiated with Suppliers include 'extras' that have not been part of the goods/service offering of past purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = Savings from free of charge 'extra' per unit * volume\n\nc. Fluctuating market price with market Index\n\nThis method of calculation is used when the cost savings can be attributed to a changing market index that results in a better future price (with respect to the market price). This method  is  applicable  for  commodities  (crude  oil,  metals,  Agri-commodities,  etc.)  where prices are linked to indices and change frequently. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = Forecasted spend with historical index value -forecasted spend with new index value\n\nd. Fluctuating market price without market Index\n\nThis  method of calculation is used when there are no market price references available. There may be no good benchmarks to indicate the savings w.r.t the market. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Initial offer -negotiated offer) * expected volume\n\ne. Volume Rebate\n\nThis method of calculation is used when the Supplier offers rebates on volume or similar incentives, which have not been included in previous purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (new rebate per unit -old rebate per unit) * volume\n\nf. Re-engineered specification (substitution) / rationalization\n\nFor some goods/services/projects, the specification can be changed to reduce the price. New specifications  examples  may  include  (but  not  limited  to)  using  black  and  white  printers instead of coloured printers, using standard cars instead of high-end cars for rentals, and using  standard  event  designs  instead  of  specialized  events.  Savings  in  this  scenario  are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Cost for original item/service -cost for substitute item/service) * volume\n\ng. In-house vs. Outsourcing\n\nFor some categories, where services are provided in-house, outsourcing of services might be a viable option. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (In-house cost (i.e. labor cost + material cost + overhead cost) -purchase price) x volume\n\nh. Lease vs. Buy\n\nFor some categories lease of goods might be a viable alternative to buying (or vice versa). To compare the savings between leasing and buying options for goods, the cost per one unit needs to be calculated and compared. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Cost of purchasing per unit - leasing cost per unit) * volume\n\ni. Reduced Cost of Disposal\n\nAt the end of their lifetime, some goods (e.g., Laptop) may be recycled. These costs need to be considered to determine the actual price of a product. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = Historic cost for disposal -new cost for disposal\n\nii. Cost Avoidance\n\nFollowing are various Cost Avoidance scenario:\n\na. Demand reduction/yield improvement\n\nThis method of calculation is used when the volume of a defined goods/service has been reduced through active negotiations by Procurement , (i.e., demand control). Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Last volume -negotiated new volume) * last price\n\nb. Reduced cost of service\n\nThis method is used to calculate the cost reductions for service (e.g., reduced maintenance cost through introduction of preventive measures). Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Historic service cost -new service cost)\n\niii. Cash Impact\n\nFollowing are the various Cash Impact scenarios:\n\na. Inventory reduction\n\nThis  method  is  used  when  the  involvement  of Procurement leads  to  a  reduction  of inventories (e.g., stock) and results in significant cost savings. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Old Inventory levels -New Inventory levels) x WACC\n\n(WACC -Weighted Average Cost of Capital)\n\nb. Payment term extension\n\nThis method is used when the involvement of Procurement results in a change of 'Payment Terms' and leads to a working capital improvement. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = Working Capital Improvement = Average monthly invoice from supplier (VAT included) * New Payment terms (in days) / 30 * WACC\n\n(VAT -Value added tax; WACC -Weighted Average Cost of Capital)\n\n1.5 Legislations applicable for Procurement\n\n1.5.1 Abu Dhabi Local Content (ADLC)\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Local Content Program aims to direct government spending towards the development of the local economy in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The tenders published by government entities must ask for the submission of the ICV Certificate, sponsored by the Department of Economic Development of Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe  weight  given  to  the  local  content  must  constitute  40%  of  the  overall  score  allocated  to  the financial/commercial  evaluation  score.  The  program  will  encourage  suppliers  to  participate  in government  tenders  to  increase  their  economic  contribution  in  Abu  Dhabi  through  Emiratization, Investments, and Locally procured goods and services. For further information regarding the Abu Dhabi Local Content program, please visit https://idb.added.gov.ae/\n\n1.5.2 Economic Incentives for MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises)\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (AD-DED) recognizes the following types of businesses as MSMEs:\n\nTable 1.5.1 MSME Classification\n\nThe Department of Government Support (DGS) has announced the following economic incentives in government Procurement for MSMEs:\n\na) All Entities/GPO shall allocate 15% of their annual purchases and contracts to MSMEs.\n\nb) All MSMEs shall be exempted from submitting the Bid Bond bank guarantee.\n\nc) All MSMEs shall be exempted from submitting the Performance Bond bank guarantee, provided that the Entities reserves 5% of the value of each invoice due for a period of 3 months after the final delivery.\n\nd) All dues shall be paid to the MSMEs within a period of 15 days from the date of the invoice.\n\ne) The  Entity  must  submit  quarterly  reports  to  the  GPO  on  the  implementation  of  the  above guidelines.\n\n1.5.3 Economic Incentives for Emirati Entrepreneurs\n\nThe organizations having Abu Dhabi DED commercial licenses and owned in 100% by UAE nationals (including  partners)  are  recognized  as  Emirati  Entrepreneurs  by  the  Abu  Dhabi  Department  of Economic Development (AD-DED).\n\nThe Department of Government Support (DGS) has announced the following economic incentives in government Procurement for Emirati Entrepreneurs:\n\na) All Emirati Entrepreneurs shall be exempted from submitting the Bid Bond bank guarantee.\n\nb) All  Emirati  Entrepreneurs  shall  be  exempted  from  submitting  the  Performance  Bond  bank guarantee, provided that the Entity reserves 5% of the value of each invoice due for a period of 3 months after the final delivery.\n\nc) All dues shall be paid to the Emirati Entrepreneurs within a period of 15 days from the date of the invoice.\n\nd) The  Entities  must  submit  quarterly  reports  to  the  GPO  on  the  implementation  of  the  above guidelines.\n\n2. Procurement Processes Groups\n\n2.1 Procurement Strategy\n\n2.1.1 Overview\n\n'Procurement  Strategy' is  a  highlevel  document  that  states  an  Entity's  approach  to  achieving  its procurement objectives, executing its activities and key initiatives. It guides on allocation of resources and budget for strategic initiatives and aligns procurement activities with Entity strategy and Abu Dhabi Governmental initiatives.\n\nThe 'Procurement Strategy'  is created  with  mid-to-long  term  perspective  and  updated  yearly.  Key elements of value proposition addressed by the 'Procurement Strategy' include (but not limited to):\n\na) Increased value to the Entity\n\nb) Improved efficiency and effectiveness\n\nc) Greater stakeholder alignment\n\nd) Enhanced external partnerships\n\nThe Head of Procurement is responsible for the creation of the Procurement Strategy. The Head of Procurement assigns  key  members  from Procurement to  create  and  monitor  execution  of  the 'Procurement Strategy'.\n\n2.1.2 Details of Level 3 Processes\n\n2.1.2.(I) Create and Execute 'Procurement Strategy'\n\n1. Scope and Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this process is to create, approve, and execute 'Procurement Strategy'.\n\n2. Procedures and Methodologies\n\ni. Conduct Internal and External Analysis\n\nAssigned  key  members  conduct  internal  and  external  analyses  as  follows,  to  develop  a 'Procurement Strategy':\n\na. Analyse Procurement -The  assigned  key  members  conduct  an  analysis  of  the  Entity Procurement on following aspects to identify procurement optimization initiatives:\n\na1. People\n\na2. Processes\n\na3. Technology\n\na4. Governance\n\nThis  analysis  leads  to  a  better  understanding  the Procurement from  the  perspective  of operating processes, organizational excellence, and knowledge and information\n\nmanagement. Post this analysis, various models (such as SWOT analysis) can be utilized to identify the key competencies and major areas of improvement.\n\nb. Conduct  Spend  analysis  In  addition  to  above, spend  data  is  collated  and  analysed  for additional optimization opportunities. This analysis provides insights into historical spend, Supplier base, and spend categories to identify the focus areas for improvement.\n\nc. Conduct Market analysis Assigned key members analyse the evolution of markets, trends and  conditions  to  assess  their  impact  on  the Procurement .  The  necessary  data  may  be collected  through  primary  and  secondary  sources.  This  data  is  updated  over  time,  to maintain  relevance.  Various  methodologies,  such  as Por ter's  five  forces (industry  rivalry, buyer  power,  Supplier  power,  threat  to  new  entrant,  substitution  possibilities),  TOWS (Threat, Opportunities, Weakness, and Strengths) and PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental) analysis may be used.\n\nd. Conduct  Benchmarking  A  'Competitive  Assessment',  conducted  through  survey  and benchmarking,  may  show  Entity's  strengths  /  weaknesses  with  respect  to  industry  best practices.\n\nThe 'Procurement Strategy' addresses the areas of improvemen ts and adjustments required to remain relevant with respect to the changes in the market.\n\nii. Develop ' Procurement Strategy '\n\nThe 'Procurement Strategy' includes the following:\n\na. Vision and Mission The vision and mission of the Procurement is derived from the vision and mission of the Entity.\n\nb. Goals / Objectives -  Based  on  the  analysis  done  in  previous sections,  assigned  members develop clear objectives for the Procurement . Following are few examples of objectives and associated guiding principles for the Procurement :\n\nTable 2.1.1 Examples - Procurement Objectives\n\nc. Key Initiatives The objectives identified in the 'Procurement Strategy' are achieved through initiatives. The initiatives are expressed with measurable outputs. These identified initiatives\n\nmust be SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely). Following are the examples of initiatives and outputs:\n\nTable 2.1.2 Examples -Procurement Initiatives and Outputs\n\nFollowing  details  should  be  provided  for  each  initiative  in  the 'Procurement  Strategy' document:\n\nc1. Name and short description with expected outputs\n\nc2. Implementation plan (including timelines and milestones)\n\nc3. Business case indicating costs and expected impact, if applicable\n\nc4. Potential challenges, risks and issues\n\nc5. Initiative Owner and resources required to execute\n\nc6. RACI for key activities\n\nd. Prioritization  of  Initiatives  The  initiatives  should  be  prioritized  considering  the  ease  of implementation and their impact/value. Initiatives may also be classified as quick wins, if applicable. Below is an illustrative example of prioritization of initiatives:\n\nFigure 2.1.1 Initiative Prioritization\n\nProcurement Manual (Business Processes)\n\ne. Implementation plan An overall high-level implementation plan and a short-term detailed action plan must be prepared for the execution of the 'Procurement Strategy'. Below is an illustrative example of an implementation plan:\n\nFigure 2.1.2 Example - Implementation Plan\n\niii. Approve 'Procurement Strategy'\n\na. The 'Procurement Strategy' is reviewed and approved by approvers designated as per the PDoA .\n\niv. Execute 'Procurement Strategy'\n\na. Execution  of  the  'Procurement  Strategy' may  require  involvement  from  other  business functions (e.g., Finance, End-User etc.).\n\nb. Execution  of  the  'Procurement  Strategy'  must  be  regularly  monitored  by  the  team  that created the 'Procurement Strategy' and reported to involved stakeholders.\n\nc. The Head of Procurement remains responsible for the execution of the 'Procurement Strategy'.\n\n3. Roles and Responsibilities\n\nTable 2.1.3 Roles and Responsibilities -Create and Execute 'Procurement Strategy'\n\n2.1.3 RACI Matrix\n\nBelow are the details of the RACI (R -Responsible, A -Accountable, C -Consult, and I -Inform) for the Procurement Strategy process group:\n\nTable 2.1.4 RACI Matrix -Procurement Strategy  process group\n\n2.2 Demand and Category Management (DCM)\n\n2.2.1 Overview\n\na) Demand and Category Management (DCM) process group consists of procedures to create, review, approve, execute, and monitor 'Category Strategy' and 'Procurement Plan'.\n\nb) This  section  explains  the  activities,  decisions  involved,  documents  used,  outcomes,  and  the stakeholders involved in the DCM processes.\n\nc) The following Level 3 processes are included in the DCM process group:\n\n1. Create and Monitor 'Category Strategy'\n\n2. Create and Monitor 'Procurement Plan'\n\n2.2.2 Details of Level 3 Processes\n\n2.2.2.(I) Create and Monitor 'Category Strategy'\n\n1. Scope and Purpose\n\ni. The purpose of this process is to create, review, approve, and monitor 'Category Strategy'.\n\nii. ' Category Strategy' enables management of Procurement spend in groups of similar or related goods/services/projects, leading to consolidation and optimization opportunities.\n\niii. 'Category Strategy' is created periodically, preferably once a yea r, for:\n\na. All Common Categories\n\nb. Entity-Specific Categories contributing to the top 80% of the Entity spend\n\niv. A Sourcing Specialist/Lead may be assigned as the Category Manager to manage the category.\n\nThe Category Manager is responsible for creation and monitoring of 'Category Strategy'.\n\n2. Procedures and Methodologies\n\ni. Conduct category analyses\n\na. To create a 'Category Strategy', the Category Manager conducts following category analyses:\n\na1. 'Internal Category Profile'\n\nThe  'Internal  Category  Profile' is  developed  by  spend  analysis  and  insights  from supplementary documentation (supplier contracts, PO). It includes details such as (but not limited to) category description, annual spend and volume, Supplier base, top 10 Suppliers by spend, and spend by subcategory.  Each detail provided in the 'Internal Category Profile' must be supported by relevant analysis.\n\na2. External Market Analysis\n\n'External Market Analysis' includes details of the industry structure and Supplier market for the category. It includes details such as (but not limited to):\n\nI. Category Definition -includes description of the category, its characteristics and other relevant information\n\nII. Value Chain -includes graphical representation of activities/processes performed or undertaken to deliver the goods/services/projects\n\nIII. Demand Drivers -includes  details  regarding  historic  and  expected  demand,  key demand  segments,  unit  price  and  price  movement,  policies  and  other  Govt. mandates that impact demand etc.\n\nIV. Supply Market Dynamics includes details regarding market size, overall industry capacity, key Suppliers , market growth and trends, mergers and acquisitions, etc. It covers  Porter's  five  forces  analysis  (buyer  power,  supplier  power,  threat  to  new entrants, substitutes, and industry rivalry).\n\nV. Cost Structure includes details regarding Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) (including but not limited to unit cost, logistics, maintenance, warranty, insurance, wear and tear,  administrative, taxes  and  overheads).  TCO  provides visibility on  cost  heads, helping estimate potential areas of cost improvement which can generate savings and spend optimization opportunities.\n\nVI. Supplier  Landscape  includes  details  regarding  key Suppliers ,  brands,  products available in the geography.\n\nb. Various information sources can be used to develop 'External Market Analysis'. These sources may include (but not limited to):\n\nb1. Primary Sources\n\n· End-Users and buyers of goods/services/projects\n\n· Suppliers and industry associations\n\nb2. Secondary Sources\n\n· Internet searches and company-specific publications\n\n· Online databases and media sources\n\n· Specialist public sector organisations\n\n· Private-sector research organisations\n\nc. It  is  recommended  that  publicly  available  secondary  sources  are  researched  before conducting primary research. The Category Manager should explore paid market research reports only if publicly available secondary sources and primary sources are not sufficient.\n\nd. The Category Manager may either use the provided template for 'Internal Category Profile' and 'External Market Analysis' or another approved template covering required elements.\n\nii. Create 'Category Strategy'\n\na. The 'Internal Category Profile' and 'External Category Analysis' provide actionable insights that serve as inputs to the 'Category Strategy'.\n\nb. 'Category Strategy' should cover (but not limited to) following sections:\n\nb1. Category Segmentation\n\nCategory Segmentation depends on the following criteria:\n\nI. Criticality  of  the  Category is  determined  by  factors  such  as  (but  not  limited  to) impact on Entity's operations in case of unavailability, and critical factors such as Health, Safety and Environment.\n\nII. Complexity  of  the  Category defines  the  inherent  nature  of  a  category  that  is governed by several factors including (but not limited to) availability of Suppliers, market  structure  (monopolistic,  oligopolistic,  competitive  etc.),  ability  to  switch Suppliers ,  possibility  of  substitution,  lead  times  and  regulations  governing  the category.\n\nBased on above parameters, the category may be classified into the following segments:\n\nFigure 2.2.1 Category Segmentation\n\nb2. Strategic Levers\n\nBased on the Category Segmentation, category optimization  and  improvement strategies (and associated levers) are selected.

Non-Abu Dhabi Suppliers (Non-AD-DED)\n\nThis category includes Suppliers that do not have a valid Abu Dhabi DED license. Such Suppliers may further be classified into:\n\ni. Local Suppliers (UAE Mainland and Freezone)\n\nii. Foreign Suppliers\n\n2.8.2 Details of Level 3 Processes\n\n2.8.2.(I) Initiate Supplier Request\n\n1. Scope and Purpose\n\ni. The Supplier onboarding process starts with a valid ' Registration Request ' .\n\nii. The purpose of this process is to create, review, and approve the 'Registration Request' and ensure that Supplier records are not duplicated in the Supplier Master Database.\n\n2. Procedures and Methodologies\n\ni. Raise ' Registration Request '\n\na. ' Registration  Request ' and  registration  requirements  change  based  on  the Supplier classification, as illustrated below:\n\nb. AD-DED Suppliers raise  a 'Supplier Self -Registration Request' by opening the 'SAP Ariba Supplier SelfRegistration Request link' and completing and submitting the 'Self -Registration Request form'.\n\nc. Non- AD-DED Suppliers request an Entity to raise an 'Entity Raised Supplier Request', on their behalf. In such cases, the Entity user logs into 'SAP Ariba Supplier Entity -Request Page', completes  and  submits  the  'Entity  Raised  Request  Form',  and  uploads  the  required documents.\n\nd. The Entity user should validate the information provided by the Supplier before submitting the request and confirm that the business requirements which are met by the Non - AD-DED Supplier cannot be met by an AD-DED Supplier .\n\ne. The  Entity  user , while  completing  the  'Entity -Raised  Request  Form'  must  confirm  the expected spend with the Supplier . In case of Foreign Suppliers , this expected spend decides the attestation requirements.\n\nFigure 2.8.1 Supplier Classification\n\nii. Review and Approve ' Registration Request '\n\na. The Supplier Registration Team Lead , upon receiving on the 'Registration Request', assigns the request to a Supplier Data Management Specialist for review and approval.\n\nb. The Supplier  Data  Management  Specialist reviews  the ' Registration  Request ' for duplication and validity of the information provided.\n\nc. If the ' Registration Request ' is  unique and provided information is accurate, the Supplier Data  Management  Specialist approves  the  request  and  assigns  himself/herself  as  the ' Supplier  Manager ' for  the Supplier .  The  ' Supplier  Manager ' acts  as  the  single  point  of contact for the Supplier during the registration and qualification processes.\n\nd. As soon as the ' Registration Request ' is  approved, the Supplier receives  an  invitation to register with 'SAP Ariba Network'. This email includes the 'SAP Ariba Registration Link'.\n\ne. In  case  of  Entity  raised  request,  the  Entity  users  is  notified  about  the  request  status (approval/denied).\n\nf. Suitable communication  channels are established to support Suppliers during the registration  process.  The Supplier  Registration  Team must  only  use  these  channels  to communicate with the Suppliers . The channels set up are:\n\nFigure 2.8.2 Communication Channels\n\nThe 'Request Additional Info' functionality is only active in 'SAP Ariba' after the Supplier has completed and submitted 'Registration Questionnaires' .  Hence it is not available during the Initiate Supplier Request process.\n\n3.

Below is an illustrative example of contract hierarchy:\n\nContains elements common to multiple Entities e.g., pricing (3AED per apple), guarantees, overall terms and conditions\n\nContains elements specific to each Entity e.g., delivery locations (Corniche 1), authorized requesters, SLAs\n\nContains delivery request(s) issues by each Entity defining date(s), quantity etc. in line with the provisions on FA and call off contract.\n\ne.g., PO for entity 1 for 3 apples at 3AED each to be delivered at Corniche\n\nFigure 2.4.1: Master Agreement -Sub-agreement Hierarchy\n\ne) Stand-alone agreement is the most commonly used contract type, entered between an Entity and Supplier for specific requirements. The Stand-alone agreement is not part of contract hierarchy.\n\nf) A Contracting Specialist/Lead is  assigned to  execute CLM processes. For a contract against an Entity-Specific Category, the Contracting Specialist/Lead is assigned from the Entity managing the category. For a contract created against a Common Category, the Contracting Specialist/Lead is assigned from the GPO.\n\ng) Contract Administrators are End-Users assigned  to execute the contract.",
