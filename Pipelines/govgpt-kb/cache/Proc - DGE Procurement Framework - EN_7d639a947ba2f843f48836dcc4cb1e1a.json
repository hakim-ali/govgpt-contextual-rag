Procurement Framework is a single document devised to help the procurement practitioners in their work, complemented with practical working aids. It explains the recommended approach and best practices for procurement operations, and is defined to promote the practice of professional Procurement.\n\n4.1.1 Purpose of the Procurement Framework\n\nThe Procurement Framework sets out principles and operating rules for running procurement operations. It offers information on the leading practices and professional requirements.\n\nIt aims to ensure consistency and professionalism in everyday procurement activities. The procurement practitioners abiding by the Procurement Framework positively influence the value for money for the government Entity they represent.\n\n4.1.2 Scope of the Procurement Framework\n\nThe Procurement Framework applies to individual procurement practitioners as well as Procurement as an organisational function within the government Entity.\n\nThe Procurement Framework applies to every purchase made by the government Entity, for goods, services and projects regulated by price list agreements, contracts or orders with the exception of goods & services indicated on the List of Exemptions (Section 2.1.3).\n\nThe Procurement Framework supersedes any existing procurement policies and procedure manual currently held by government Entities. Entities are expected to align their operations with the Procurement Framework.\n\nThe Procurement Framework includes:\n\n\n\nProcurement Principles –\n\nSection 1\n\n\n\nProcurement Policy –\n\nSection 2\n\n\n\nProcurement Charter –\n\nSection\n\n3\n\n\n\nProcurement Processes –\n\nSection 4\n\n\n\nSales Auctions –\n\nSection 5\n\nProcurement Templates – Available on the Digital Procurement Platform\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n:  Procurement Framework\n\n4.1.3 Compliance with the Procurement Famework\n\nThe procurement practitioners must have knowledge and understanding of the Procurement Framework.\n\nProcurement shall ensure that the Procurement Framework is communicated and made available to all the relevant stakeholders across the government entity.\n\nProcurement shall be responsible for ensuring that the procurement practitioners act in compliance with the Procurement Framework.\n\nProcurement practitioners shall sign a declaration undertaking the responsibility to ensure that the procurement function of the government entity operates in compliance with the Procurement Framework.\n\n4.1.4 Quality Assurance\n\nProcurement shall ensure a quality assurance and improvement program is in place that covers all aspects of the procurement function and ensure continuous development of the function.\n\n4.2 Definition of Procurement\n\nProcurement is the function that ensures identification, sourcing, and access to optimal goods, services, and projects that the Abu Dhabi Government Entities (ADGE or ‘Entities’) and its end-users require to fulfil their objectives.\n\nProcurement exists to explore supply market opportunities and to ensure optimal implementation of the sourcing strategies that deliver the best possible supply outcomes for the government Entity.\n\nProcurement adds value and help respective government Entities accomplish set objectives by:\n\nDeploying a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and address the Entity’s needs collaboratively.\n\nExecuting activities spanning the entire supply cycle from understanding of requirements and evaluating the need for them, identifying and analysing potential supply options, and all the way through to contracting with suppliers and fulfilment of contracts.\n\nOn-going management of relationships with amongst others end-users, respective Legal and Finance functions, and suppliers, through the monitoring of supply contracts, execution of purchasing and evaluation of the supplier performance & risk.\n\nContinuous evaluation & execution of strategic & tactical initiatives to enhance Procurement’s value realization for Abu Dhabi Government (ADGOV).\n\n4.3 Core Principles\n\nThe Procurement Framework articulates ten integrated Core Principles which all procurement practitioners and suppliers must adhere to when engaging in procurement operations on behalf of, or to, an Abu Dhabi Government Entity (ADGE).\n\nThe following Core Principles define key values and approaches aimed at promoting effectiveness of the Procurement function:\n\n\n\n4.4 Code of Business Ethics\n\nObjectives and Scope of the Code of Business Ethics\n\nThe Code of Business Ethics aims to:\n\nEstablish principles and rules regulating the work of all procurement practitioners and stakeholders in accordance with the business ethics expected of the procurement profession with its provisions applicable to all procurement practitioners within Entities abiding by the Procurement Framework.\n\nPromote ethical behaviour and emphasise accountability of the procurement practitioners and stakeholders towards protecting the reputation of the government Entity they represent, preventing impropriety and unfair business conduct in procurement operations.\n\nGeneral Principles\n\nThe execution of procurement on behalf of a government Entity involves the expenditure of funds where procurement practitioners are expected to conduct all activities with integrity to achieve sound commercial decisions.\n\nViolation of the Code of Business Ethics due to lack of awareness of its contents is considered a breach of the code and is not deemed acceptable.\n\nProcurement practitioners must be fully aware and act in accordance with the Code of Business Ethics where procurement practitioners found in breach of the code shall be held accountable for their actions and will be liable for disciplinary/legal action based on the situation and applicable legislations.\n\nIt is the responsibility of all procurement practitioners to immediately report any violation of the Code of Business Ethics to their direct manager or the Head of Procurement to verify and take the necessary action.\n\nThe Code of Business Ethics sets forth the following eight principles that assure ethical procurement:\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Enablement Standards\n\nThe Enablement Standards define the attributes of functions and individuals involved in procurement operations. They describe requirements for actors, relations and setup conditions required to perform the procurement function effectively.\n\n4.5.1 Organisation of the Procurement Function\n\nProcurement shall execute its operations through an organisational unit led by the Head of Procurement.\n\nThis unit may be established within or outside of the government Entity and shall be independent of the other units of the government Entity. It shall be empowered and capable of executing the duties and responsibilities entrusted to Procurement.\n\nThe role of the Head of Procurement shall be assigned to an executive level position.\n\nProcurement must conduct its activities through professional staff consisting of individuals, procurement practitioners, possessing academic qualifications, professional certificates, practical experience, and skills needed to perform assigned responsibilities.\n\nProcurement comprises of Gov. Procurement and Entity Procurement. The Procurement Operating Model provides the mandate, empowerment, and responsibilities of Gov. Procurement and Entity Procurement. Gov. Procurement is established to fulfil the following:\n\nConsolidate Entity demand for achieving economies of scale and execute sourcing for common categories, excluding Entity-specific categories.\n\nProvide shared services such as Supplier Registration, Item Master Management, User Master Management, and Training.\n\nMaintain the Procurement Framework, ensuring a standardised and efficient way of working across Abu Dhabi Government Entities.\n\nManage and operate the Digital Procurement Platform.\n\nRun market development initiatives and manage partnerships with the private sector in coordination with the relevant authorities.\n\nEngage stakeholders from the Abu Dhabi Government Entities and dedicated Finance, Legal or other resources as needed for procuring common categories.\n\nTogether with internal and external stakeholders, embed sustainable & green procurement practices across the Procurement activities.\n\n4.5.2 Procurement Internal Controls\n\nProcurement shall act in line with the internal controls implementing segregation of duties to prevent fraud and errors. No one individual shall control consecutive stages of the procure-to-pay cycle. There shall be segregation of duties between the requisitioning, approving, contracting, ordering, receiving, and payment for goods, services, and projects. If separation at the level of roles is not possible, then separation must be maintained at the individual level where individual separation requires the approval of any performed activity by another individual (four-eyes principle).\n\nSegregation of duties requires separation of requestors or receivers and accounts personnel, as well as separation of requestors and approvers.\n\nProcurement shall maintain an electronic audit trail documenting the segregation of duties for each sourcing activity and each transaction.\n\nIn line with transparency, accountability, and to enable due diligence checks, all related documentation shall be retained in accessible file(s) on the Digital Procurement Platform (ERP).\n\n4.5.3 Information Technology Platform and Master Data\n\nProcurement shall:\n\nUtilise an information technology platform for procurement operations, the digital procurement platform.\n\nManage access of the procurement practitioners, other relevant employees and external parties to the digital procurement platform and grant required authorisations in collaboration with DGE Master Data Team.\n\nManage the category hierarchy for goods, services, and projects, which shall serve as a primary structure for planning, execution, and reporting.\n\n4.5.4 Roles of the procurement practitioners\n\nProcurement of each government Entity shall identify and document the roles and duties of the procurement practitioners ensuring compliance with the Procurement Framework.\n\nThe roles must be created in alignment with the strategic, tactical, and operational processes defined.\n\n4.5.5 Procurement Delegation of Authority\n\nThe Procurement Delegation of Authority, the PDoA, shall be issued by Gov. Procurement and shall define the approval levels, threshold values, and decision-making authority for various procurement activities across all Entities.\n\nIn case of unique Entity needs not addressed via the overarching PDoA, Entities shall amend the PDoA to address its unique procurement needs and shall describe division of authority and powers in the government Entity related to procurement operations.\n\nEntity-specific PDoA components shall adhere to certain general guidelines which shall be issued by Gov. Procurement. Entities are not permitted to reduce the approval levels or increase the threshold values set in the general delegation of authority to reduce approval strictness.\n\nEntity-specific PDoA components must contain required workflows to ensure the minimum level of governance identified for any procurement activity and specified by Gov. Procurement. Additional workflow may be added based on the entity’s requirements, in alignment with Gov. Procurement.\n\nThe PDoA must contain all the financial and non-financial authorisers related to all procurement activities, and will be embedded in the Digital Procurement Platform (ERP).\n\nThroughout this framework document, the term 'Procurement Delegation of Authority (PDoA)' shall carry the following meanings:\n\nPDoA shall refer to the general delegation of authority set by Gov. Procurement, and all references to PDoA shall be interpreted accordingly.\n\nIf Entity-specific PDoA components have been established by the respective Entity, PDoA includes the Entity-specific PDoA components.\n\n4.5.6 Procurement Stakeholders\n\n4.5.6.1 Coordination with the requesting party\n\nProcurement shall undertake actions to facilitate collaboration and coordination with the requesting party, from now on referred to as the end-users, to ensure requirements are understood and fulfilled.\n\n4.5.6.2 Coordination with Finance and Legal\n\nProcurement shall closely coordinate with the Finance and Legal functions within their respective government Entity.

The target for the upcoming year is to be determined before the end of the previous year and circulated to all ADGEs as a requirement across Procurement.\n\nDGE shall coordinate with DED & ADGEs to determine appropriate targets for allocating MSME spend and utilization of MSMEs, as part of the target setting exercise.\nDGE shall, in coordination with relevant ADGE’s and stakeholders use the following criteria but not limited to:\n\nConduct demand gathering sessions with ADGEs to identify and analyse future demands.\n\nReview historical spend data to identify MSME spend across categories.\n\nExamine the existing supplier base (Supply) to ensure that MSMEs can fulfil the requirements needed.\n\n4.5.8.2.2.1 Mandatory Sourcing Lists\n\nDGE in coordination with DED shall identify with ADGEs a list of items to be procured from MSMEs only, this list will be made mandatory and circulated with all ADGEs prior to the start of the year to allow ADGEs ample time to plan their purchases accordingly.\n\nSourcing of items in the MSME mandatory list shall be limited only to registered and qualified MSME suppliers. DGE, in coordination with DED, shall ensure that all items identified in the mandatory list are items that have a sufficient supplier base, and will ensure competitive tendering.\n\n4.5.8.2.2.2 Contract Award Splitting\n\nIn order to increase market participation of MSME’s in larger contract, ADGES are encouraged to analyse contracts for split award through conducting market assessments and supplier base assessments to determine existing market capabilities aimed at identifying service offerings with a strong MSME supplier base and analyse prepositive contracts to identify areas where the contract may be split to smaller segments.\n\n4.5.8.2.2.3 Considerations for MSME Sourcing Activities\n\nADGEs shall ensure that MSMEs are invited to tenders and provide sufficient information to them to promote their intention to bid.\n\n4.5.8.2.2.4 Transparency & Equality of Opportunities\n\nADGEs shall promote MSME involvement in tenders issued, aiming to pro-actively seek MSME participation which includes conducting sessions with MSME suppliers to understand capabilities and expand on existing capabilities across categories.\n\n4.5.8.2.3 MSME Enablement Program and Initiatives\n\nDGE in coordination with DED shall develop programs and initiatives towards supporting MSMEs in government procurement, increasing market participation of MSMEs, developing capabilities of MSMEs to enhance their ability to become qualified suppliers.\n\n4.5.8.2.4 Economic Incentives for MSMEs\n\nADGEs shall ensure that MSME payments are made within the payment cycle set by DGE.\n\nADGEs shall exempt MSMEs from providing a bid bond guarantee.\n\nADGEs shall exempt MSMEs from submitting the performance bond bank guarantee, provided that the Entities reserves 5% of the value of each invoice due for a period of three (3) months after the final delivery.\n\nAll dues shall be paid to the MSMEs within a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of the invoice.\n\n4.5.8.3 Economic Incentives for Emirati Entrepreneurs\n\nThe organizations having Abu Dhabi DED commercial licenses and owned in 100% by UAE nationals (including partners) are recognized as Emirati Entrepreneurs by the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (AD-DED).\n\nThe Department of Government Enablement (DGE) has provided the following economic incentives in public procurement for Emirati entrepreneurs:\n\nAll Emirati entrepreneurs shall be exempted from submitting the bid bond bank guarantee.\n\nAll Emirati entrepreneurs shall be exempted from submitting the performance bond bank guarantee, provided that the Entity reserves 5% of the value of each invoice due for a period of three (3) months after the final delivery.\n\nAll dues shall be paid to the Emirati entrepreneurs within a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of the invoice.\n\n4.5.8.4 Economic Localization Growth Program\n\nA    The Economic Localization Growth Program aims to increase the localization of products and services that are procured by ADGEs to decrease reliance on imports of such products and services.  This is done by identifying investment opportunities for local manufacturing through analysing historical spend and future spend forecasting. The program works closely with local stakeholders to present the opportunities to prospect investors to setup manufacturing or services businesses in Abu Dhabi.\n\nB      For localization of products and/or services, ADGEs shall work with DGE to provide specific government procurement incentives to support investor outreach efforts.

It is imperative to note that the procurement process is not merely transactional; it is a strategic undertaking aimed at minimizing our investments, ensuring utmost efficiency, and upholding the integrity of the government.\n\nIntent of this policy is to solidify procedures that guarantee both fiscal responsibility and adherence to best practices. This policy not only aims to secure the best value for financial investments but also emphasises the broader implications of procurement decisions, including the social, economic, and environmental dimensions.\n\nEvery individual within the Entity involved in procurement activities must meticulously abide by this policy to minimize potential risks and maintain uniformity and effectiveness throughout our procurement initiatives.\n\n5.1.1 Types of Procurement\n\nPrice list agreements.\n\nContracts.\n\nPurchase orders.\n\nProcurement of goods.\n\nProcurement of services.\n\nProcurement of projects including capital assets.\n\n5.1.2 Procurement Capability and Operating Model\n\nThe Procurement capability and operating model comprises four types of capabilities: Strategic, Tactical, Operational, and Support as illustrated below:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure\n\n2\n\n:\n\nProcurement Capability Model\n\n5.1.2.1 Strategic Procurement Capability\n\n5.1.2.2 Tactical Procurement Capability\n\n5.1.2.3 Operational Procurement Capability\n\n5.1.2.4 Supporting Capability\n\n5.1.3 List of Exemptions\n\nThe Procurement Framework does not apply to:\n\n\n\nDirect employment contracts or the engagement of individual experts which cannot be subject to tender, and their staff salaries and benefits.\n\nGeneral and administration expenses for non-predefined technical specifications, electricity, water, utilities, accommodation rentals.\n\nProfessional and non-professional bodies’ subscriptions, and fees paid to organisers of conferences/exhibitions.\n\nRental of property and buildings for the use of government offices and operations (example, student accommodation).\n\nAgreements among government Entities or with international professional bodies or spend with legal entities organized and operated for a collective, public or social benefit (e.g. non-profit/charities/niche culture organization) for the purposes of research/collaboration/promotions.\n\nSponsorships and grants.\n\nPurchase of artworks, artifacts, associated ancillary expenses, agreements for niche individuals, publishers, and organizations in the culture & creative industries.\n\nCopyrights license fees except where there is a contractual obligation to purchase goods, services, or projects.\n\nReimbursement of ad hoc expenses incurred during travel (below Petty Cash threshold).\n\nMandatory or Regulatory fees (such as court fees, duties and taxes, bank fees etc.).\n\nPartnerships and joint ventures\n\nFinancial incentive programs to promote small enterprises to invest in events in Abu Dhabi\n\nNiche Training Programs for government staff\n\nAny other exceptions approved by DGE.\n\n\n\n5.2 Procurement Strategy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Introduction\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Procurement Strategy section covers the Creation of Procurement Strategy (Section 2.2.2), the Elements of the Procurement Strategy (Section 2.2.3), and Implementation of the Procurement Strategy (Section 2.2.4).\n\nA procurement strategy is a written strategy for the procurement function. It comprises initiatives which are executed to fulfil strategic objectives of the procurement function. It is a high-level document that states an Entity’s approach to achieving its procurement objectives, executing its activities and key initiatives. It guides on allocation of resources and budget for strategic initiatives and aligns procurement activities with Entity strategy and Abu Dhabi Governmental initiatives.\n\nThe procurement strategy is integral to achieving the overall strategy of the government Entity. To that end, the written procurement strategy, which may be part of the broader organisational strategy of the government and its Entities, shall be created across two levels:\n\nGov. Procurement will prepare a holistic procurement strategy covering the overall vision, mission, and strategic initiatives for the Procurement across all Entities.\n\nProcurement within the Entities will prepare Entity-specific procurement strategies, derived from the Gov. Procurement Strategy.\n\nProcurement is responsible for the creation of a procurement strategy and may assign key members from Procurement to create and monitor execution of the Procurement Strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Creation of Procurement Strategy\n\n\n\n\n\nFor long-term strategic initiatives, if applicable, the budget will be reviewed annually as part of the Procurement Strategy update. During the review, the progress & status of the initiative over the previous year will be assessed, and budget allocation for the upcoming year as well as the remaining duration of the initiative will be re-aligned.\n\n5.2.3 Elements of the procurement strategy\n\nThe Procurement Strategy shall include, but not be limited to, the following elements:\n\nProcurement’s vision, mission, and strategic objectives.\n\nProcurement categories with their high-level strategies.\n\nDemand management insights, targets, and actions.\n\nSupply options with impact, risk, and compliance assessment.\n\nThe potential for rationalisation, standardisation, and economies of scale.\n\nCompleted, ongoing and planned strategic actions.\n\nDevelopment and management of the relationship with key stakeholders.\n\nSupplier collaboration & development initiatives for strategic suppliers.\n\nGreen/Sustainable Procurement initiatives, measurable goals, and sustainable sourcing roadmap.\n\n5.2.3.1 Vision & Mission\n\nProcurement’s vision and mission shall align with those of the government Entity. They shall be in line with the Core Principles and are part of the procurement strategy.\n\n5.2.3.2 Strategic Goals and Objectives\n\nProcurement shall set strategic goals and objectives based on the vision and mission. The goals describe what decisions are to be made and the commitments we take in order to reach them. The objectives describe what will be achieved.\n\nProcurement will align the objectives and goals with input from end-users and Finance, establishing key performance indicators that will be used to report fulfilment of the procurement strategy.\n\nProcurement shall ensure that all stakeholders in the government Entity, including procurement practitioners, are aware of the strategic goals and objectives.\n\nProcurement shall assign performance objectives to procurement practitioners in line with the strategic goals which shall be used to assess the performance of the procurement practitioners.\n\nThe procurement strategy shall be submitted for approval in accordance with the PDoA.\n\n5.2.4 Implementation of the Procurement Strategy\n\nEntities’ procurement practitioners shall plan the implementation of the approved procurement strategy, identifying and prioritising potential initiatives based on internal and external analysis, and where necessary, seek inputs from the end-users acting as subject matter experts.\n\nAppropriate business cases for initiatives shall be prepared by Procurement. The execution of the initiatives shall be planned against an annual calendar. The business case must be created for initiatives related to the procurement of projects.\n\nProcurement shall continuously track the execution of procurement strategy and pro-actively communicate its progress to Finance, end-users, and relevant stakeholders.\n\n5.3 Demand and Category Management\n\n5.3.1 Introduction\n\nProcurement shall drive demand and category management to establish a clear understanding of the demand and ensure the right supply of goods, services, and projects to enable government Entities to achieve their objectives.\n\nDemand management involves developing forward-looking estimates of the required goods, services, and projects by having a clear understanding of specifications, quantities, timelines, and importance. It drives cost efficiencies through challenging and consolidating the requirements of end-users to standardise purchases, eradicate wasteful practices and avoid unnecessary costs.\n\nCategory management is a structured approach that aims to develop plans and strategies to deliver value for a specific category of spend. It considers internal and external environments for reducing procurement costs, driving innovation, and mitigating risks.\n\n5.3.2 Category Management\n\n5.3.2.1 Category Taxonomy\n\nCategory taxonomy refers to a hierarchical assignment of goods/services in line with global best practices.\n\nCategory assignment should be based on the nature of goods or services being procured and shall be aligned with relevant government guidelines and the Procurement Code of Ethics.\n\nUnder no circumstances should a different category be assigned solely based on budget availability.\n\n5.3.2.2 Category Classification\n\nClassification of a category as a common category or an Entity-specific category depends on the category spend value and its commonality across Entities. A category that is procured by five or more Entities shall be considered as a common category.\n\nFigure 3:\n\nCommon vs. Entity Specific Categories\n\nCategory management for common categories is performed by Gov. Procurement in alignment with and based on information collected from the involved Entities. Entity-specific requirements within common categories are to be documented and addressed in the common category strategy.\n\n5.3.2.3 Category Analysis\n\nProcurement practitioners (within Entities and Gov. Procurement) responsible for managing categories shall perform detailed analysis of categories, focusing on internal and external factors to identify opportunities for driving savings and efficiencies. Category analysis shall be carried out through an internal and external category profile.\n\n\n\nInternal category profiles\n\nshall at the minimum include the following elements:\n\nDescription of the category with its scope and use.\n\nSpend profile showing the distribution of spend, suppliers, and contracts.\n\nDemand profile outlining current and estimated business needs.\n\nStakeholders’ profiles relevant for the category.\n\n\n\nExternal category profiles\n\nbased on market analysis which shall at the minimum include the following elements:\n\nIndustry structure and its added value chain.\n\nMarket structure and trends including size, business segments, prices, and commodity indices.\n\nAnalysis of economic factors driving the demand.\n\nAnalysis of total cost and cost drivers of the category.\n\nSupplier landscape including the number, composition and standing of the major suppliers.\n\nAnalysis of forces that determine the competitiveness of the industry, including its sustainability impact.\n\nProcurement practitioners may either use the provided template for internal category profile and external market analysis or another approved template covering required elements.\n\n5.3.2.4 Category Strategy\n\nProcurement practitioners responsible for managing categories shall utilise the results of category analysis to develop strategies, which set an overall direction for the management of categories through initiatives.\n\nA category strategy enables management of procurement spend in groups of similar or related goods/services/projects, leading to consolidation and optimisation opportunities.\n\nProcurement practitioners may seek cross-functional inputs for developing the category strategy, if required.\n\nCategory Strategy must identify value levers that reduce procurement costs, drive innovation & sustainability, and efficiency while mitigating risks associated with the category.\n\nCategory Strategy shall leverage available information on Supplier Risk and Supplier Performance in developing and managing the category.\n\n5.3.2.5 Creation of Category Strategy\n\nCategory strategies for common categories are developed by Gov. Procurement. Entities are recommended to develop a category strategy for Entity-specific categories using the provided templates.\n\nAn SME may be assigned as the Category Manager to manage the category. The Category Manager is responsible for the creation and monitoring of the category strategy.\n\nA category strategy is created periodically, preferably once a year for:\n\nAll common categories.\n\nEntity-specific categories contributing to the top 80% of the Entity spend.\n\nProcurement shall prepare category segmentation as a part of the overall category strategy. The category segmentation shall consider at a minimum the following:\n\nCriticality of category for the government Entity.\n\nEase of supply of goods, services and projects including Supplier substitution.\n\nPotential benefits to be realised.\n\nSaving strategies per category level shall be developed following the benefits tracking guidelines from Section 2.3.5.\n\nProcurement practitioners may seek cross-functional inputs for developing the category strategy, if required.\n\nProcurement may involve end-users in the creation of the category strategy and share the completed and internally approved category strategy with Gov. Procurement for documentation.\n\nThe planned sourcing initiatives captured in the category strategies are to be consolidated in the procurement plan.\n\n5.3.2.6 Approval of Category Strategy\n\nThe category strategy, along with supporting documents, is reviewed and approved in accordance with PDoA.\n\n5.3.2.7 Implementation of Category Strategy\n\nThe approved category strategy is shared with the relevant stakeholders for execution.\n\nExecution of the category strategy is reviewed periodically by Procurement. During each review, individuals assigned to execute the category strategy shall provide updated status of respective initiatives.\n\nProcurement should, in collaboration with the other stakeholders involved, monitor, and report the cost savings, and other value delivered as part of planned and unplanned initiatives in the category.\n\nAny modifications made to the category strategy shall undergo reviews and approval in accordance with PDoA.\n\nThe category strategy is considered complete when all identified initiatives are executed. Completion of the category strategy will be communicated to all relevant stakeholders.\n\n5.3.3 Procurement Planning\n\n5.3.3.1 Consolidated Annual Demand\n\nDemand gathering should be done for all goods, services, and projects which require engagement of procurement function to execute sourcing, and which will serve as input for creating the procurement plan to ensure that the government Entity operates normally and continuously.\n\nAt an Entity level, demand requirements are collated across departments within the Entity.\n\nEnd-users shall provide to Procurement the best estimates of annual requirements for goods, services, and projects. The information collected must, at the minimum, include:\n\nIdentification of requirements against the Category Hierarchy and their specifications. Procurement should verify appropriate category against each demand requirement.\n\nEstimated quantity and expected budget for the goods, services and projects planned.\n\nProcurement timelines with expected delivery dates for goods and schedules for services and projects.\n\nSpecific demand for the procurement of projects indicating plan, the scope of work and potential suppliers for each planned project.\n\nProcurement shall seek advice from the end-users in estimating budgets for the demand based on historical data, prices, and market insights.\n\nThe schedule for demand planning shall be conducted in alignment with the Abu Dhabi Government’s budgeting cycle (refer to Table 1: Procurement Planning Approach), and Procurement shall communicate to End-users the consolidated annual demand.\n\nProcurement shall be responsible for the demand consolidation activity and its results.\n\n5.3.3.2 Demand Optimisation\n\nProcurement shall validate the consolidated demand against historical demand trends to verify the submitted estimates. Procurement shall investigate any abnormalities found in the estimated demand with the end-users and suggest revisions as necessary.\n\nProcurement shall verify demand raised by the end-users to ensure consumption and purchasing are at optimal levels. To achieve this, any wasteful practices identified shall be eradicated by applying levers including, but not limited to:\n\nHistorical consumption trend comparison.\n\nConsolidated demand for common categories will be shared with Gov. Procurement following the budgeting cycle (refer to Table 1: Procurement Planning Approach). Gov. Procurement will identify joint sourcing opportunities to be consolidated in the procurement plan.\n\nOrder quantity optimisation.\n\nAppropriate substitute’s introduction.\n\nRequirements standardisation.\n\nInventory optimisation.\n\nSupply risk mitigation.\n\n5.3.3.3 Procurement Plan\n\nProcurement planning determines how best to fulfil the consolidated demand captured from within the government Entity. Its objective is to balance supply and demand so that the government Entity achieves the financial and service delivery objectives.\n\nThe procurement plan defines all requirements for goods, services, and projects to be procured over a period of time. It establishes the high-level timelines for the sourcing activities. Procurement shall use the procurement plan to consolidate similar requirements under same contracts.\n\nThe procurement plan shall contain sourcing initiatives to bridge the demand-supply gap through collation and optimization of demand requirements and understanding the demand-supply gap based on existing contracts and inventories per each category.\n\nThe procurement plan focuses on the examination of operating contracts and selection of sourcing methods to renew existing or creating new supply agreements.\n\n5.3.3.4 Procurement Plan Creation\n\nThe procurement plan is created on an annual basis and is required to be developed for all categories. Creation of the plan follows the timeline for budgeting cycle (refer to Table 1: Procurement Planning Approach).\n\nProcurement shall at least consider the following parameters while preparing the procurement plan:\n\nNeeds and requirements.\n\nQuantities and estimated costs.\n\nBudget requirements.\n\nOpportunities for demand consolidation.\n\nAppropriate procurement methods and processes.\n\nSchedule of sourcing events.\n\nReadiness and potential risk mitigation.\n\nProcurement may include in the procurement plan initiatives other than sourcing events, related to demand management, supplier relationship management, contract lifecycle management and other procurement responsibilities.\n\nProcurement practitioners shall include in the procurement plan the schedule of sourcing events for their Entity-specific categories, having at a minimum the timelines of planned activities and the involved parties.\n\nProcurement practitioners shall prepare the Procurement Plans for their own categories.\n\nProcurement practitioners are responsible to coordinate with Finance where required, to ensure alignment between the Budget and Procurement Plan (refer to Table 1: Procurement Planning Approach).\n\nThe procurement plan will follow review and approval in accordance with the PDoA approvals.\n\n\n\n5.3.3.5 Procurement Financial Bridging\n\nProcurement shall develop consolidated demand requirements plan estimated for the categories. It shall represent mid-term spend plan used to feed financial budgeting.\n\nThe budgets shall include split between operational (OPEX) and capital (CAPEX) expenditures.\n\nDuring the execution, in case of a budget shortfall, the end-users shall collaborate with Finance to increase or re-allocate budget and align with Procurement on the outcome.\n\n5.3.3.6 Procurement Plan Approach\n\nThe table below describes the key milestones and accountable functions for developing the Procurement Plan, which is based on the Finance budgeting cycle. The specific timeline for each milestone may vary depending on the timeline of the budgeting cycle established by Finance.\n\nTable\n\n1\n\n:\n\n– Procurement Planning Approach\n\n5.3.3.7 Procurement Plan Monitoring\n\nProcurement shall monitor the execution of the procurement plan. End-users and procurement practitioners should adhere to the demand submitted and allocated in the Finance budgeting cycle. Deviations from the demand submitted for- and captured in the Procurement plan shall be approved on an exceptional basis. Deviations must be justified with valid reasons that are communicated and agreed upon with the relevant stakeholders.\n\nAny modifications and changes made to the Procurement Plan shall go through reviews and approval as per the PDoA.\n\n5.3.4 Unplanned Procurement\n\nUnplanned procurement refers to the acquisition of goods, services, or projects that were not included in the original budget or planned procurement activities.\n\nUnplanned procurement may be justified under the following circumstances:\n\nEmergencies that pose an immediate risk to continuity of operations, for instance due to property damage.\n\nUnforeseen needs that could not have been anticipated during the budgeting process.\n\nUrgent requirements that provide an opportunity to achieve structural cost reduction or improve public service delivery.\n\nIt is key to manage the number of unplanned procurement activities to minimise risks and uphold public trust.\n\nExecution of unplanned procurement activities shall adhere to the following guidelines:\n\nJustification is documented and submitted by the end-users and reviewed by Procurement.\n\nThe need is sourced via a competitive bidding process in line with the Sourcing Policy (Section 2.4).\n\nAlignment with Finance shall be conducted to align budget impact and ensure re-allocation of budget, to avoid overall budget impact.\n\nExplicit adherence to government, regulations, guidelines, and ethical standards.\n\nProcurement will monitor and periodically report unplanned procurement activities to ensure transparency and accountability.\n\n5.3.5 Benefits Tracking\n\nProcurement shall track the benefits delivered to the government Entity through cost reduction, cost avoidance, service level, and internal procurement workload to avoid urgent orders.\n\nProcurement shall develop appropriate and consistent methodologies for calculating the benefits delivered.\n\nProcurement shall develop credible baselines to measure benefits considering at a minimum the following:\n\nHistorical costs.\n\nPreviously contracted rates.\n\nBudget estimates or allocation.\n\nProjected cost increase resulting from macroeconomic factors, or Supplier requests.\n\nProcurement shall collaborate with the end-users for inputs required to track the benefits and may engage Finance and subject matter experts for validation.\n\nProcurement shall regularly report the benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Sourcing\n\n5.4.1 Introduction\n\nProcurement, through the sourcing process, identifies the right suppliers to efficiently and cost-effectively fulfil the government entity’s requirements for goods, services, and projects.\n\nProcurement shall manage the sourcing cycle and may engage other parties when necessary, such as (but not limited to) the end-user/requestor, Finance, Legal or suppliers.\n\nProcurement shall strive, where possible, to standardize specifications & consolidate demand in order to establish Framework Agreements, which creates procurement efficiency & scaling of benefits.\n\nThe sourcing process includes gathering specifications and requirements, identifying appropriate sourcing methods, preparing procurement documents, executing sourcing, and awarding contracts. Procurement shall facilitate a fair and transparent process to award tenders to the most qualified supplier(s).\n\nSourcing for an Entity-specific category is conducted by the Entity managing the category while in case of a common category, the sourcing process is conducted and managed by Gov. Procurement, providing government-wide agreements available to all Entities. If none of the suppliers listed in government-wide agreements meet the specific requirements of the Entity, the Entity shall promptly engage with Gov. Procurement to explore alternative solutions.\n\nThe principles outlined in this chapter apply to all suppliers. For more specific guidelines on sourcing MSMEs, please consult Section 1.5.8.\n\n5.4.2 Budget Approvals and Financing\n\nThe end-users/requestors shall ensure all raised requisitions have sufficient budget, full specifications, realistic cost estimates and delivery date. Procurement shall coordinate with the end-users/requestors to develop a realistic cost estimate (utilising market research, historical price trends or budgetary quotations) for sourcing activities.\n\nFinance shall determine if sufficient budget and approvals exist for the requirement. If the budget is not approved or is insufficient, the end-users/requestors must obtain the necessary approvals and align with the Finance to (re-)allocate budget prior to creating a purchase requisition.\n\nFor tenders requiring a multi-year contract, end-users/requestors, in collaboration with Procurement, shall seek alignment and review with Finance for the allocation of budget. Multi-year contracts follow review of Finance as per the PDoA.\n\nProcurement shall ensure that the end-users/requestors allocate additional budget in coordination with Finance before commitment, in case of shortfall.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Feasibility Study\n\nProjects above ten million (10,000,000) AED require a feasibility study. Feasibility studies may be requested for projects below this spend threshold, if required.\n\nProcurement shall ensure requestors prepare feasibility studies for purchases of goods, services and projects requiring justification in accordance with the PDoA. In the case of procurement of projects, the feasibility studies created during the investment planning phase shall be verified and appropriated.\n\nWhere possible, Procurement shall ensure that feasibility studies explore opportunities for cross-organisational collaboration within the government Entity.\n\n5.4.4 General Guidance for Sourcing\n\nProcurement shall adhere, at a minimum, to the following during the sourcing process:\n\nRequests to source products/services/projects shall be verified by the end-users/requestors against existing contracts and inventories to identify if the requirement can be fulfilled without entering new obligations.\n\nProcurement requirement shall not be split to bypass approval authorities.\n\nSourcing for projects shall be initiated after the project has been approved per the PDoA.\n\nAppropriate sourcing method and sourcing channel shall be selected by Procurement before commencing the sourcing activities.\n\nEvaluation of opportunities to consolidate demand and negotiate Framework Agreements.\n\nA technical evaluation team/individuals, if mandated by the PDoA, shall be set up for sourcing including the representatives of the requestors as well as subject matter experts relevant for the domain of the request.\n\nProcurement practitioners shall drive sourcing activities.\n\nSourcing shall be executed electronically through the digital procurement platform (ERP).\n\nProcurement may request a supplier (when required) to sign a confidentiality agreement and non-disclosure agreement (NDA), before sharing any confidential information or before submitting the proposal.\n\nSuppliers shall be given the opportunity to raise questions and request clarifications during the sourcing activity.\n\nInformation gathering and dissemination shall be done in an open, fair, and transparent manner with all suppliers having equal access to information. All Q&A shall be distributed to all suppliers.\n\nClear audit trail capturing document transmission between Procurement and suppliers shall be maintained electronically to facilitate tracking and auditing.\n\nSuppliers shall be given reasonable time to submit proposals with an option to request for extensions. Extending a timeline is approved by end-users and follows the guidelines stated in Section 2.4.12.\n\n\n\nFigure 4 below illustrates the afore-mentioned guidelines to enable decision making for the sourcing processes:\n\n\n\nFigure 4:\n\nSourcing Guidelines\n\n\n\n5.4.4.1 Exceptions to Sourcing Guidelines\n\nThe following are applicable exceptions to the sourcing guidelines:\n\nExecuting a tender greater than five million (5,000,000) AED as a limited tender. This deviation from the guidelines require endorsement from the Procurement Committee.\n\nNot requiring a bid bond for a tender greater than five million (5,000,000) AED or bid bond value higher than 1% of the estimated tender value shall be considered as a deviation from the guidelines and will require endorsement from the Procurement Committee.\n\nExceptions from the authorisations granted in the guidelines with regards to the “Performance Bond”, “Bid Bonds” and “Advanced Payment Guarantee” require endorsement of the Procurement Committee.\n\nPurchases without raising purchase orders are permissible only for exempted goods, services, and projects and Petty Cash/Purchase Card (Section 2.1.3).\n\n5.4.5 Sourcing Channels\n\nRefers to the means of requesting a response from bidders. A request may be published to simply obtain information from suppliers (RFI) or obtain quotation for well-defined goods or services (RFQ), or even a comprehensive proposal for a service or project (RFP).\n\nProcurement shall select the appropriate sourcing channel for execution of the sourcing activity. The choice of sourcing channel (RFP, RFQ, RFI, and reverse auctions) does not depend on the spend threshold, but on the nature of goods, services, and projects being sourced.\n\n5.4.5.1 Request for expression of interest\n\nA request for expression of interest (EOI) serves as an announcement aimed at identifying suppliers interested in participating in a sourcing activity. Suppliers are required to submit detailed information before a specified deadline.\n\nIt is recommended that the Procurement practitioner requests the EOI before starting a Limited & Public Tender, especially for tenders with high value, high complexity, and when the participation of certain key suppliers is key for the success of the tender or when it is not certain that at least 3 technical capable suppliers will respond.\n\nThe submitted information shall be used to assess suppliers and shortlist vendors eligible for participating in the tendering process.\n\nSufficient time shall be assigned for suppliers to respond.\n\nTo ensure transparency and accessibility, the EOI shall be advertised digitally.\n\n5.4.5.2 Request for Information (RFI)\n\nA request for information (RFI) shall be used for gathering information or budget estimates from a broad base of potential suppliers. The RFI facilitates preparation of the RFP or the RFQ, developing strategy, shortlisting suppliers, or building a database.\n\nDuration of an RFI depends on the type of project. Extending the sourcing activity timelines should follow the guidelines established in Section 2.4.12.\n\n5.4.5.3 Request for Proposal (RFP)\n\nA Request for Proposal (RFP) shall be used for seeking proposals from suppliers. The RFP is best suited for situations where the end-users know what they want to achieve and rely on suppliers to propose the solution. The RFP relies on the experience and creativity of suppliers to define the best solution and may be followed by the RFQ or negotiations.\n\nDuration of RFP depends on the type of project. Extending the sourcing activity timelines should follow the guidelines established in Section 2.4.12.\n\n\n\n5.4.5.4 Request for Quotation (RFQ)\n\nA Request for Quotation (RFQ) shall be used for seeking pricing information for a defined scope of work or supply of specified goods or services. The specifications, terms and expectations must be defined in the RFQ.\n\nDuration of RFQ depends on the type of project. Extending the sourcing activity timelines should follow the guidelines established in Section 2.4.12.\n\n5.4.5.5 Reverse Auction\n\nA reverse auction may be used as an alternative to the RFQ for highly commoditised goods, services, and projects or where specifications have already been fully acknowledged by participating suppliers. The reverse auction shall be conducted between several pre-selected suppliers registered for the category to help achieve savings.\n\nProcurement may provide a ‘reserve/starting price’ to set a common baseline for placing the bids. Procurement must ensure that fairness and confidentiality is maintained while conducting reverse auctions. Details of the participants and their offers shall not be publicly disclosed.\n\nReverse auction can also be (optionally) applied by Procurement as a second round of the RFP, independent of the value of the tender.\n\n5.4.6 Sourcing Methods\n\nA tender may be published to all interested suppliers (public tender), screened and shortlisted suppliers (limited tender), or a single supplier (single/sole source).\n\nProcurement shall refer to the guidelines for selection and use of the appropriate sourcing method obtaining relevant approvals. Recommended sourcing method, in relation to the tender value, has been specified in the guidelines as follows (refer to Figure 4: Sourcing Guidelines):\n\n5.4.6.1 Public tender\n\nA public tender shall be open to all suppliers allowing them to participate and register on the digital procurement platform (ERP) for placing the bids. It shall be accessible through the ERP and shall be publicly announced.\n\nPublic tenders are mandated for goods, services, and projects equal to or above five million (5,000,000) AED, although it is recommended to conduct tenders publicly below this threshold to encourage transparency and competition.\n\nPublic tenders are also required for the selection of pre-approved suppliers for a specific area of spend as part of a Framework Agreement.\n\nA minimum of three (3) suppliers must submit bids for a tender in order to maintain the condition for competitive bidding. If the Entity receives less than three (3) bids, the condition for competitive bidding is not met. If procurement chooses to continue with this bid, it will be considered as a single source.\n\nIn case multiple supplier bids were received yet the technical panel qualified only one (1) bid, conditions for competitive bidding are not met. Hence, this will be considered as single source tender.\n\n5.4.6.2 Limited Tender\n\nA limited tender shall be open to a predefined number of registered and qualified suppliers, which can be recommended by end-users/requestors and approved as per the PDoA.\n\nProcurement may include additional registered suppliers that are appropriate for the sourcing before closing date.\n\nLimited tenders can be carried out for tenders greater than or equal to one million (1,000,000) AED but less than five million (5,000,000) AED.\n\nCompetitive bidding conditions applicable to public tenders also extend to limited tenders.\n\n5.4.6.3 Sole Source method:\n\nThis type of tendering method may be adopted on an exceptional basis where there is only one qualified supplier capable of supplying the required goods, services, or projects with whom the contract may be established.\n\nValid justification must be provided by end-users/requestors for utilising sole source tendering method.\n\n5.4.6.4 Single Source method\n\nThis type of tendering method may be adopted on an exceptional basis where only one qualified supplier is invited from a pool of registered suppliers for bidding.\n\nValid justification must be provided by end-users/requestors for utilising single source tendering method whereas Procurement shall endeavour to suggest suitable alternatives whenever the single source tender is suggested by the end-users.\n\n5.4.6.5 Single/Sole source guidelines\n\nThe decision to proceed with the sole source or single Source methods require approval as defined in the PDoA.\n\nIn the case of sole source, the following (at a minimum) must be provided by requestors/end-users for obtaining approval:\n\nExplanation for using sole source that include but are not limited to:\n\nUniqueness of product or service.\n\nCompatibility or interoperability with existing systems, equipment, or processes, intellectual property rights or specific regulatory requirements.\n\nIn the case of single source, the following (at a minimum) must be provided by the requestors/end-users for obtaining approval:\n\nExplanation for using the single source method.\n\nBusiness case justifying the single source method.\n\nRelevant information about the requirement such as category, quantity, estimated value, source of production, approvals from concerned authorities, delivery date or schedule for goods, services, and projects.\n\nPrice comparison.\n\nProcurement shall use appropriate sourcing methods to initiate new or update existing contracts for requested goods, services, and projects.\n\nProcurement shall communicate lead-time for each sourcing method, so that end-users may factor the relevant processing time in their planning.\n\n5.4.7 Identification of sourcing need\n\nProcurement shall initiate a sourcing cycle when a procurement need has been identified either by end-users/requestors or through the procurement planning exercise.\n\nProcurement shall initiate a sourcing initiative in the ERP. The initiative shall be approved by the appropriate authority as per the PDoA.\n\nProcurement shall analyse the requirement and determine whether it can be fulfilled through an existing contract or if there is a need for a new contract. If Procurement determines that a sourcing activity is required to initiate a new contract, then it shall identify relevant stakeholders, determine critical business requirements, and conduct internal analysis and market research to develop the sourcing strategy.\n\n5.4.8 Sourcing Strategy\n\nProcurement shall develop a sourcing strategy for achieving the objectives set in the category strategy and procurement plan.\n\nA sourcing strategy is mandatory for sourcing initiatives greater than or equal to one million (1,000,000) AED and optional for initiatives less than one million (1,000,000) AED.\n\nProcurement shall conduct further detailed assessment of internal trends, market opportunities, risks, and supplier base, if not sufficiently covered in the category strategy.\n\nThe sourcing strategy may include (but not limited to) following details:\n\nObjective and scope of the sourcing activity and expected duration of the engagement with the supplier for the acquired goods, services, or projects.\n\nSelected sourcing method and the appropriate request channel based on the objectives of the sourcing activity. Selection of these follow the guidelines in Section 2.4.4, 2.4.5 and 2.4.6\n\nExpected benefits and their measurement methods.\n\nA detailed plan for each sourcing activity including milestones, timelines and responsibilities of involved stakeholders including end-users, technical evaluation team/ technical evaluator, the Procurement Committee, Finance, Legal, subject matter experts and suppliers.\n\nSupplier long list (not applicable for public tenders) – exhaustive list of suppliers who can potentially supply the required goods, services, or projects and are considered for screening and shortlisting for sourcing activities.\n\nEvaluation methodology for the tender including criteria for technical and commercial evaluation with its assigned weight as per Section 2.4.13. Procurement practitioners may either use the provided template for developing Sourcing Strategy or another approved template covering the required elements.\n\nProcurement shall promote cross-functional collaboration by engaging the technical evaluation team for providing inputs to the sourcing strategy when mandated by the PDoA.\n\nProcurement shall obtain the approval of sourcing strategy as per the PDoA.\n\n5.4.9 Screening of Suppliers\n\nProcurement shall establish supplier screening criteria and screen potential registered suppliers with support of Supplier Master Database to shortlist the most competent and high-performing suppliers. The screening criteria established by Procurement may be based on, but not limited to:\n\nExisting business relationships with other organisations/suppliers’ commercial standing which includes business relations with reputed organisations.\n\nLegal standing which includes information regarding past litigations, suspension of business activities, bankruptcy, and liquidation.\n\nTechnical capabilities which include the provision of technical staff with required know-how, manufacturing or service equipment, distribution network and certifications related to quality, health, safety, and environment.\n\nQuality of the goods, services and projects established by reviewing the successful competition of previous contracts and business performed successfully.\n\nHistorical supplier performance assessed by evaluating the supplier performance scores available in the ERP.\n\nSupplier sustainability practices.\n\nEnd-users/requestors may recommend registered suppliers for sourcing. Procurement is encouraged to augment the list of recommended suppliers based on the supplier database, previous contracts, and market intelligence.\n\nProcurement shall prioritise and extend invitations to suppliers offering products listed in the latest published Golden List provided by DED.\n\nProcurement shall also consider and extend invitation to CSR suppliers and MSMEs suppliers, as well as suppliers with sustainable initiatives.\n\nIn the case of procurement of projects, Procurement shall include any suppliers proposed during the planning. The supplier screening criteria for the procurement of projects may be recommended by the end-users/requestors of the projects.\n\n\n\nAll suppliers that participate in the tender need to registered and qualified for the category that is the subject of the sourcing initiative\n\nbefore\n\nthe tender is launched, regardless of the sourcing method.

The following exceptions apply:\n\nSpend exempted from the Procurement Framework, as listed in the List of Exemptions (Section 2.1.3).\n\nSpend purchased via Petty Cash or P-card (Section 2.7.3).\n\nEmergency purchases in accordance with the guidelines of Section 2.7.9.\n\nFinance will address invoices that violate the ‘No PO No Pay’ Policy in accordance with the guidelines in the Finance Policy.\n\nProcure to Pay encompasses the following activities: requisition, tendering, ordering, receiving and invoice payment for goods/services/projects.\n\nEnd-users shall initiate the requisition and are accountable for the receiving stage. Procurement shall be responsible for creating and managing purchase orders, whereas the invoice handling and payment section is led by Finance.\n\nThis section is organised as follows:  Section 2.7.2 provides guidance on requisition creation and governance. Section 2.7.3 outlines the definition, structure, and criteria of the approved buying channels for ADGOV. Sections 2.7.4 to 2.7.15 detail the guidelines governing the execution of procure to pay.\n\n5.7.2 Guidance for Raising Requisition\n\nEnd-users/requestors shall raise purchase requisitions through the Digital Procurement Platform (ERP) incorporating at least the following details:\n\nSpecifications, scope, and schedule (if required).\n\nRequired quantities considering existing inventory and actual demand.\n\nRelevant category.\n\nRealistic purchase requisition price.\n\nReasonable need by date.\n\nEnd-users shall ensure that purchase requisitions are created before the commitment to the supplier is made and before purchasing the good and/or service. In case this is not feasible, the end-user should create a post-factum purchase requisition which requires approval via the appropriate PDoA. Upon approval, Procurement will facilitate creation of an associated Post-Factum PO.\n\nPurchases bought via Petty Cash, P-card, or for goods & services on the List of Exemptions (Section 2.1.3) do not require creation of a post-factum PR/PO.\n\nEnd-users/requestors are prohibited from splitting purchase requisitions into several transactions and routing transactions through different buying channels to avoid defined threshold values in the PDoA. Procurement shall be responsible to monitor compliance.\n\nProcurement shall endeavour to satisfy the received requisitions, having them consolidated with an optimal number of purchase orders. When considering whether transactions should be combined, only similar transactions must be considered.\n\nRequestors can order on behalf of other end-users when applicable to streamline government operations. Authorisation to do so is governed by the Digital Procurement Platform.\n\n5.7.3 Buying Channels\n\nAll purchasing activities shall be conducted exclusively through authorised buying channels designated by the Entity.

The Supplier Master Database contains a unique record of each supplier.\n\nThe Supplier Registration Team, at the Department of Government Enablement (DGE), is responsible for onboarding and maintaining the Supplier Master Database.\n\nThe principle of Segregation of Duties applies to supplier master data management in order to ensure the integrity of the supplier master data. Requests need to be provided in writing, including detailed description of the rationale for supplier record creation, change, or deactivation. All supplier master data alterations require approval as per the PDoA.\n\nChanges impacting supplier financial details (e.g., bank details) require approval from approvers of, at least, two separate functions to adhere to internal controls.\n\n5.8.2.1 Supplier Master Data Creation\n\nRefers to adding a new supplier to the Supplier Master Database following the registration request guidelines outlined in Section 2.6.2.\n\nFor registration, suppliers must provide information such as (but not limited to) license and tax information, contact details, goods and services, authorised representatives, payment Information and primary/ secondary bank details. All foreign suppliers must provide Attestation Requirements documentation as applicable per Section 2.6.2.1.\n\nThe DGE Supplier Registration Team shall be responsible for:\n\nValidating the information provided and ensuring documentation required is correct.\n\nDetermining supplier enablement and restrictions, such as the categories or Entities for which a supplier can provide its services.\n\nApproving the registration of the supplier, as per the PDoA.\n\nEnsuring that each supplier is only listed once in the Supplier Master Data, and no duplications arise.\n\nEntities specified can conduct business (i.e., raise purchase order) with the supplier after the supplier has been qualified as per Section 2.6.2.2.\n\n5.8.2.2 Modify Supplier Master Data\n\nThe supplier may need to update the information provided due to multiple reasons including (but not limited to):\n\nAdd/modify a category which can be served by the supplier.\n\nModify information due to an update on the Supplier’s end (e.g., address, bank details).\n\nModification due to a regulation change.\n\nChanges in supplier master data are subject to validation and approval from DGE Master Data Team.\n\n5.8.2.3 Deactivate Supplier/Reactivate Supplier\n\nNo longer commercially active suppliers should be deactivated. Deactivated suppliers are not visible in any search list, cannot participate in tenders, and cannot be awarded contracts.\n\nAll existing contracts as well as outstanding invoices with the supplier must be terminated before deactivating a supplier.\n\nReasons for deactivating suppliers include:\n\nSupplier with expired commercial/industrial license.\n\nSuppliers that Procurement does not wish to trade with in the future, such as blacklisted suppliers.\n\nSupplier relationship was terminated, and no new supplier activities are foreseen (e.g., one-off suppliers).\n\nSuppliers with no active contracts and without Procurement transactions for more than twenty-four (24) months.\n\nDuplicated supplier in the system.\n\nSupplier can be reactivated under the following criteria:\n\nUpdated trade license is provided.\n\nBlacklisted supplier status has been lifted.\n\n5.8.3 Item Master Data Management\n\nItem Master Data Management (Item MDM) consists of guidelines for the creation and maintenance of records of items representing unique goods/services/projects.\n\nThe Item Master Database is a database of unique materials with associated specifications, item numbers and purchasing specifications.\n\nThe Item Master Data team, as part of the DGE Master Data team is responsible for establishing and maintaining the accurate, consistent and complete record of items. The Item Master Data team will act based on input from Procurement and involved end-users.\n\nFor adding, modifying or deleting an item record in the Item Master Data, the Entity requestor shall raise a request that will be reviewed and approved as per PDoA.\n\n5.8.4 User Master Data Management\n\nUser Master Data Management consists of the guidelines associated with the creation and maintenance of records of individuals involved in procurement activities.\n\nUser Master Data holds the record of applicable employees involved in the Procurement activities, both within Procurement, Finance, Legal, and related business functions.\n\nThe User Master Data holds the roles of the respective employees in the Digital Procurement Platform and ensures the correct rights and access are given to responsible parties participating in Procurement activities.\n\n5.9 Key Performance Indicators\n\nKey Performance Indicators help Procurement determine the performance of the Procurement function and define appropriate actions to achieve set goals. There are three types of Procurement KPIs:\n\nStrategic – owned by Gov. Procurement.\n\nCommon – owned by Gov. Procurement.\n\nOperational – owned by the Entity.\n\nThe Gov. Procurement is responsible for creating the calculation methods for each common and strategic KPIs. These methods will be applied consistently across all Entities, and Entities are expected to follow these established calculations. Any modifications to these methods will be made by Gov. Procurement only and promptly communicated to all Entities.\n\nRecognising the distinct goals and contexts of each Entity, the Entities are encouraged to additionally define and implement Entity specific Operational KPIs, tailored to their unique requirements.\n\n5.9.1 KPIs monitoring\n\nGov. Procurement shall be responsible for monitoring and publishing strategic and common KPIs through consolidation of all data. Results of these shall be published and communicated on a regular basis to Entities.\n\nIn cases where KPIs are not met according to the predefined targets, the following actions to take corrective measures are to be implemented:\n\nRoot Cause Analysis: Used to determine the causes of the failure to meet KPIs. This examination will aid in a better comprehension of the underlying problem. Procurement shall develop corrective actions to deal with the problems found.\n\nEscalation: Depending on the performance indicator, issue shall be promptly and transparently communicated and escalated to the appropriate stakeholders on the status of unmet KPIs to take corrective measures.\n\nPerformance improvement plans: Performance improvement plans shall be created by Procurement in consultation with the relevant Entities and stakeholders, when necessary, where performance gaps persist for an extended period. These plans will specify the precise actions, due dates, and roles for achieving the necessary KPI levels.\n\n5.10 Procurement Reporting\n\nReporting encompasses the creation of reports to monitor and analyse Procurement performance based on KPIs, as well as the compliance to the Procurement Framework. Reporting is based on:\n\nTransactional data encompassing procurement transactions, including but not limited to sourcing activities, demand of Entities, contracts, POs, and GRNs.\n\nMaster data consisting of supplier, item, and user insights.\n\nThe DGE Master Data team is responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Procurement Master Data components, while the availability and accuracy of transactional data is subject to the quality of transactional documents created by Procurement, Finance, and the end-user.\n\nProcurement will generate reports based on the required reporting timelines, and subject to the needs of the stakeholders, including but not limited to:\n\nReporting on the common and strategic KPIs for procurement that have been established by Gov. Procurement.\n\nReporting on Entity-level operational KPIs.\n\nStandard reporting based on category.\n\nSignificant risks and problems, as well as strategies for managing them.\n\nOther applicable reporting as required.\n\nEntities are recommended to leverage the standard reports available to ensure consistency and comparability across Entities.\n\nFor reporting on common and strategic KPIs, the minimum required criteria, frequency of reporting, as well as structure of reports and specifications shall be defined by Gov. Procurement.\n\n5.10.1 Guidelines for Reporting\n\nReporting under procurement shall be classified into:\n\nProcurement Strategic Reporting: Involves high-level insights and reports that support strategic decision making in Procurement. Strategic reporting shall be in alignment with the Procurement Strategy and shall provide information of trends, opportunities for spend optimisation, and strategic initiatives linked to strategic KPIs and DGE objectives.\n\nStrategic reporting shall be done at Gov. Procurement level for all common strategic KPIs. Gov. Procurement will share insights from strategic reporting with the Entities periodically, and where applicable.\n\nEntities shall develop strategic reports for Entity-specific categories and Entity-specific strategic initiatives. If applicable, Strategic reports shall be aligned with the strategy department of the Entity when necessary, providing input on the criteria or conditions that need to be met. Entities are recommended to share the associated insights with Gov. Procurement for reference where applicable.\n\nStrategic reporting at Entity level shall be prepared by Procurement.\n\nProcurement Operational Reporting: Provides detailed information about the operational aspects of procurement and day-to-day activities. Operational Reporting is aimed to enhance Procurement operational efficiency and day-to-day compliance to Procurement policies and processes across the Procure-to-Pay activities.\n\nOperational Reporting shall be conducted at the Entity-level and shall be prepared regularly as well as ad-hoc, based on occurring Procurement needs. The frequency of the report may vary depending on the nature of the report, Activities requiring continuous monitoring, are recommended to be reported on a daily or weekly basis.\n\nProcurement Management Report: Procurement shall present the Procurement Management Report of the Procurement function bi-annually to the Chairman of the government entity. The elements of the Procurement Management Report shall include at the minimum the following:\n\nSpend value per category.\n\nSpend value per Supplier.\n\nContracted price for goods, services and projects.\n\nDelivered savings against planned savings for each category validated by the Finance.\n\nSigned price list agreements.\n\nContracts against the plan and issued orders.\n\nStatus of the procurement of projects against the plan Ageing of due invoices.\n\nSupplier and the end-users’ satisfaction to be reported yearly.\n\nStatus of strategic initiatives against the plan.\n\nCompliance with approved buying channels and contracts for each category.\n\nDetails of sole source or single source tenders awarded including value of award supplier particulars and approved justification.\n\nEmergency purchases made including value of purchase, supplier particulars and approved justification.\n\nDetails of escalations or complaints received from internal or external parties regarding procurement operations.\n\nAny important outstanding matters for the management’s decision and other relevant information.\n\nGov. Procurement shall work on consolidating common standard reports in case of cross-Entity reporting needs and linked to cross-Entity strategic and operational initiatives. This consolidation aims to simplify reporting procedures, removing the need for Entities to create separate reports. The Entities shall collaborate with Gov. Procurement to review and ensure data at Entity level is accurate and correct. Common reports will be available to the Entities for review, and analysis.\n\n\n\n5.11 Inventory Management\n\n5.11.1 Inventory classification\n\nInventory items are assets meant for consumption during the rendering of services, or for sale or distribution as part of regular Entity course of business activities.
