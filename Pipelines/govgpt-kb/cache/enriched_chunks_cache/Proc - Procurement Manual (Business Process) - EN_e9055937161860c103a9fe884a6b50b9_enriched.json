Baseline Spend\n\nBaseline  Spend  is  the  foundation  of  the  Procurement  Benefits  calculation.  It  is  the  value  of addressable spend against which any benefit is measured. Establishing a baseline is the first step in the Procurement Benefits calculations process.\n\n2.

Baseline could be",
    "The text chunk outlines the requirements for establishing and validating the baseline used in procurement benefits calculations, specifying that baselines must be agreed upon and signed off by relevant stakeholders, can be based on historic spend data, must be supported by appropriate data sources, and require a suitable calculation method tailored to each benefit type.\n\n Benefits calculations and must be signed-off by the relevant stakeholders from the End-User , the Finance and the Procurement .\n\nii. Baseline could be historic actuals (e.g., prior year spend, budgeted spend, etc.).\n\niii. The baseline must be supported by one or multiple data sets, such as  Accounts Payable (AP) data, Purchase Orders (PO) data, Contracts data, etc.\n\niv. An appropriate method to calculate the Baseline Spend should be determined for each type of procurement benefit.\n\n2. Procurement Benefits calculation principles\n\ni. Procurement Benefits can be calculated after acceptance of a final, binding offer from one or more Supplier(s) and the acknowledgment of offer conditions (with written confirmation, Letter of Intent, contract amendment, etc.).\n\nii. Benefits implementation  costs (one-time investments) are excluded from  the benefits calculation.\n\n1.4.3 Calculation Methodologies\n\n1. Baseline Spend\n\nBaseline Spend is based on two parameters and is calculated as following:\n\nBaseline Spend = Total Volume * Baseline Unit Price\n\nTotal volume may be known or unknown. However, two methods can be used for calculations to estimate volume, as detailed:\n\nTable 1.4.2 Volume Estimation Methodologies",
    "The chunk explains the methods for estimating a baseline unit price when historical purchase data is unavailable: by using comparable price baselines—comparing prices of similar goods or services with known prices from other entities—as an alternative to historical baselines, and outlines the use of new price baselines when neither historical nor comparable data exists.\n\n unknown. However, two methods can be used for calculations to estimate volume, as detailed:\n\nTable 1.4.2 Volume Estimation Methodologies\n\nBaseline unit price may be estimated using one of the following methodologies:\n\ni. Historic price baseline\n\nHistoric price baseline is relevant when the goods/services/projects were purchased previously (in last year). Below are the details of various methods to create a historic price baseline:\n\nTable 1.4.3 Historic Baseline Price Calculation Methodologies\n\nii. Comparable price baseline\n\nIf a certain goods/service has not been purchased previously, historic price baseline cannot be established. In such cases, the baseline price can be estimated using comparable goods/services/projects  (identical  or  similar  specifications)  where  the  price  is  known.  (e.g., estimating  the  baseline  price  for  a  car  rental  service  by  comparing  it  with  similar  services previously purchased by another Entity).\n\niii. New price baseline\n\nIf  neither  a  historic  nor  a  comparable  baseline  can  be  established,  a  new  baseline  can  be developed based on the initial RFI or RFP/RFQ",

The baseline price  will  be  calculated  as  an  average  of  the  approved  initial  quotes.  Any  price  reductions received through follow-on RFP/ auction/negotiation is considered as benefits.\n\n2. Procurement Benefits\n\nAs illustrated in Table 1.4.1 , Procurement Benefits are classified into three buckets:\n\ni. Cost Savings\n\nFollowing are the various Cost Savings scenarios:\n\na. Standard Method (last paid price -new price)\n\nThis  method  is  used  when  the  savings  result  from  the  difference  between  baseline  and negotiated price. For example, when Suppliers are changed or when similar goods/services/projects  are  bundled,  resulting  in  a  better  price  per  item.  Savings  in  this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (baseline price -negotiated price) * volume\n\nb.

    "The chunk explains how to calculate cost savings when commodity prices are tied to a fluctuating market index; it describes that savings are achieved by comparing forecasted spending based on a previous index value versus a new, more favorable index value, and is applicable to frequently indexed commodities like crude oil, metals, and agricultural products.\n\n price) * volume\n\nb. Free of charges Extra\n\nThese are the savings realized when contracts negotiated with Suppliers include 'extras' that have not been part of the goods/service offering of past purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = Savings from free of charge 'extra' per unit * volume\n\nc. Fluctuating market price with market Index\n\nThis method of calculation is used when the cost savings can be attributed to a changing market index that results in a better future price (with respect to the market price). This method  is  applicable  for  commodities  (crude  oil,  metals,  Agri-commodities,  etc.)  where prices are linked to indices and change frequently. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = Forecasted spend with historical index value -forecasted spend with new index value\n\nd. Fluctuating market price without market Index\n\nThis  method of calculation is used when there are no market price references available. There may be no good benchmarks to indicate the savings w.r.t the market. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Initial offer -negotiated offer) * expected volume\n\ne. Volume Reb",
    "The chunk explains how to calculate cost savings resulting from changing product or service specifications to less expensive alternatives, by comparing the original cost to the substitute's cost and multiplying by the expected volume.\n\n. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Initial offer -negotiated offer) * expected volume\n\ne. Volume Rebate\n\nThis method of calculation is used when the Supplier offers rebates on volume or similar incentives, which have not been included in previous purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (new rebate per unit -old rebate per unit) * volume\n\nf. Re-engineered specification (substitution) / rationalization\n\nFor some goods/services/projects, the specification can be changed to reduce the price. New specifications  examples  may  include  (but  not  limited  to)  using  black  and  white  printers instead of coloured printers, using standard cars instead of high-end cars for rentals, and using  standard  event  designs  instead  of  specialized  events.  Savings  in  this  scenario  are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Cost for original item/service -cost for substitute item/service) * volume\n\ng. In-house vs. Outsourcing\n\nFor some categories, where services are provided in-house, outsourcing of services might be a viable option. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings =",
    "The chunk explains that at the end of a product's life, such as a laptop, recycling or disposal costs should be factored into the total cost of ownership, and any reduction in these costs compared to previous disposal methods is considered a savings.\n\n categories, where services are provided in-house, outsourcing of services might be a viable option. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (In-house cost (i.e. labor cost + material cost + overhead cost) -purchase price) x volume\n\nh. Lease vs. Buy\n\nFor some categories lease of goods might be a viable alternative to buying (or vice versa). To compare the savings between leasing and buying options for goods, the cost per one unit needs to be calculated and compared. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Cost of purchasing per unit - leasing cost per unit) * volume\n\ni. Reduced Cost of Disposal\n\nAt the end of their lifetime, some goods (e.g., Laptop) may be recycled. These costs need to be considered to determine the actual price of a product.

Reduced cost of service\n\nThis method is used to calculate the cost reductions for service (e.g., reduced maintenance cost through introduction of preventive measures). Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Historic service cost -new service cost)\n\niii. Cash Impact\n\nFollowing are the various Cash Impact scenarios:\n\na. Inventory reduction\n\nThis  method  is  used  when  the  involvement  of Procurement leads  to  a  reduction  of inventories (e.g., stock) and results in significant cost savings.
