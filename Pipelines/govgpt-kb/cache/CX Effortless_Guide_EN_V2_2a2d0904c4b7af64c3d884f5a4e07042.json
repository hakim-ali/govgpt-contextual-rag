The secret to providing public services without effort lies in achieving two main principles:\n\nPROGRAM PRINCIPLES\n\n01\n\nEmpowering the Customer\n\nThis includes reducing the customer's need to communicate with or visit the entity to obtain the desired service, request information, and other needs through:\n\n· Providing distinguished self-services.\n\n· Adopting  and  implementing  the  best  practices  that  prevent  the occurrence of problems that prompt customers to communicate with the entity more than once to solve these problems. In  other words, providing services to the customer without the need to communicate with the entity or through a single contact as a maximum.\n\n· Using  the  best  behavioural practices  to  understand  the  customers' behaviours  and  needs  and  anticipate  their  next  moves.\n\n02\n\nCustomer Support\n\nIn the event that the customer is required to communicate with the entity to obtain support regarding  a  specific  service  or  information,  or  to obtain a solution to certain challenges they face, the entity shall provide all means for this through:\n\n· Providing CX agents with the required experience and skills, such as flexibility, proactiveness, and willingness to solve the complex issues faced by the customer.\n\n· Providing  CX  agents  with  advanced  training  to  deliver  a  positive customer experience and  provide them with the required skills to manage  complex  customer  interactions  when  they  need  support.\n\nHOW TO MEASURE AN EFFORTLESS CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE\n\nCustomer Experience performance is measured and monitored through three  types  of  measurements:\n\n01 Customer Perception Measurements\n\nThe customer perception measurements consist of a set of main indicators, the most important of which are:\n\n· Customer Effort Score: It is an increasingly important measure in the government  sector that expresses the amount of effort the customer has made to obtain the service.\n\n· Customer  Satisfaction  Score:  It  is  a  measure  that  expresses  the emotional  perception  of  the  customer  upon  receiving  the  service.\n\n· Customer  Experience  Index:  It  is  an  indicator  that  expresses  the customers' evaluation of a set of service standards such as the speed of  obtaining  the  service,  ease  of  access,  quality  of  information, professionalism of the CX agents, customer privacy, and the appearance  of  the  service  delivery  environment.\n\n02 Service Measurements\n\nA set of internal indicators that express the level of performance of service delivery and the efficiency of the staff responsible for providing it. The following  indicators  affect  the  effort  that  the  customer  experiences  to obtain the service, and therefore these metrics are considered important to the Abu Dhabi government:\n\n· Service Speed: The time required to obtain the service from starting from the time of searching for  the service until it is fully obtained (from start to finish).\n\n· Ease of Use: The procedures necessary to complete the service,  the number  of visits, steps, points of  contact,  and  the  documents needed  to  complete  the  service.\n\n· Ease of Access to the Service: The amount of movement necessary for the customer to complete obtaining the service.\n\n· CX Agents Professionalism: The skills that the customer experience employee  possesses  to  support the  customer  while  obtaining  the service.\n\n03  Customer Experience Capability Measurements\n\nThese  expresses  the  maturity  level  of  the  capabilities  of  the  customer experience in the entity, which are the capabilities  of  strategic  direction, design, development, and delivery according to The International Model for Customer Experience in Government which is followed in the government of Abu Dhabi. Service Speed: The time required to obtain the service from starting from the time of searching for  the service until it is fully obtained (from start to finish).\n\nSTRATEGIC THRUSTS OF VISION\n\nThe  following  strategic  thrusts  have  been  adopted  to  achieve  the vision of the Abu Dhabi Program for Effortless Customer Experience:\n\n01 Customer Experience Policy and Guide\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Government Effortless Customer Experience Policy and Guide has been developed to define the strategic direction to improve the performance of services provided through all channels and to clarify the main roles and tasks of strategic partners in the process of designing, developing, and delivering government services jointly and systematically.\n\n02 Priority Setting\n\nThis strategic thrust addresses the most important priorities of government services and seeks to focus efforts and resources around them.\n\n03 Design Lab\n\nThe Abu Dhabi government will establish a pioneering laboratory for designing government services and coordinating their development by working with strategic  partners  from  the  public  and  private  sectors  and  cooperating through it with the most important global competencies in this field.\n\n04  Capability Building\n\nThis strategic thrust focuses on developing the skills necessary to provide world-class  government  services  by  focusing  on  customer  experience employees  who  provide  services  face-to-  face  and  by  using  technical devices.  These  thrusts  highlight  their  assessment  and  development  of modern and advanced skills required by the new roles of CX agents in  the government  sector.  This  goal  also  focuses  on  service  designers  and developers by providing them with accredited professional specializations.\n\n05 Measuring Customer Experience Performance\n\nIt is not possible to develop what is not measured. Therefore, this strategic dimension  focuses  on  developing  an  advanced  model for measuring customer experience performance, and this is done in cooperation with a group of leading academic institutions and governments in this field.\n\nDEVELOPING ABU DHABI PROGRAM FOR EFFORTLESS CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Program for Effortless Customer Experience was designed based on comparisons with the best international standards and practices in  the  field of customer experience and in line with the ambitions and culture of the Abu Dhabi government. The  program has also been designed in a scientific way and includes a set of studied stages to ensure that the components of the program are aligned with the nature of government work in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe design of the program included the following stages:\n\n01 Maturity Levels Assessment\n\nAn extensive study of the current maturity levels of customer experience practices in the Abu Dhabi government has been carried out by international assessors.\n\nThe assessment included 45 government service providers and companies in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The assessment process was based on the  dimensions of  The  International Model  for  Customer  Experience  in Government.\n\nThe assessment process highlighted the strengths of current practices, and it led to the discovery of areas for improvement and development that were taken into account when identifying the strategic thrusts of the program.\n\n02 Determining the Baseline of the Customer Effort Score\n\nCustomers' perceptions were measured based on the evaluation of the extent of  effort being made to obtain services so that this result is considered as the baseline for the measure of customer effort in Abu Dhabi and as a basis for setting future goals in this regard.\n\n03  Pilot Application\n\nAn  experimental application  of  the  program  was  implemented  in cooperation with three government entities: namely, the Department of Municipalities and Transport, the Department of Economic Development, and the Department of Community Development, to collect the necessary data to align the components of the program with the nature and culture of government work in the Emirate.  During  this  stage,  the  technical  tool accompanying the program was tested and the necessary modifications were made to match the current maturity levels and the future method of work required by the program.\n\n04  Completing the Development of the Customer Experience Framework\n\nThe International Model for Customer Experience in Government and the results of the pilot application were used as a base for developing the final version of the Abu Dhabi Framework for Effortless Customer Experience to ensure that the framework is compatible with the nature and culture of government work in Abu Dhabi and is consistent with best practices in this regard.\n\nNOTES\n\n2\n\nSECTION TWO\n\nABU DHABI FRAMEWORK FOR EFFORTLESS CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Framework for Effortless Customer Experience consists of 4 main dimensions and 22 sub dimensions as shown below.

Related  modern  technologies.\n\nThe challenge statement is formulated using  visual tools or other effective methods  to  illustrate  the  challenge  and  its  multiple  elements  to  create  a common language among team members. It is essential that the final problem statement  features:\n\n· Qualitative data can be obtained through focus groups, in-depth interviews with customers and frontline and backend staff and service development teams, detailed ethnographic work, comprehensive audits, eye, and face tracking technology, etc.\n\n· Quantitative  data  can  be  obtained  through  questionnaires,  performance measurement systems, accounting systems, etc.\n\n2.3\n\nExperience Baselining\n\nUse holistic, reliable, and timely data to baseline the current state of the service after establishing a deep understanding  of  the  problem  and  identifying  the problem  statement  clearly.\n\nThe as-is service scope is specified across different channels as well as customer segments. Measurement could include but is not limited to:\n\n· Number of customers affected by/benefiting from the service.\n\n· Number of service transactions.\n\n· Channel capacity.\n\n· Current service demand.\n\n· Future service demand.\n\nAs-is customer perceptions are determined across the entire service and/or  specific  touch  points  (whenever applicable) and across different channels. Measurement could include but is not limited to:\n\n· Customer Satisfaction.\n\n· Quality of Service.\n\n· Customer Effort.\n\n· Customer Trust.\n\n· etc.\n\nThe as-is state of the service is measured from an operational point of view across different channels.

Related to the entity's mission and scope of authority.\n\n2. The existence of a final product or outcome obtained by the customer, which adds value to meet their needs.\n\nTherefore, the partial procedures that are required to be completed to obtain the service (for example the process of paying fees or print documents, etc.) are not considered to be a service.\n\nWhat is the Service Classification Mechanism?\n\nThe process of classifying the services of the entity helps to understand its services  accurately,  which supports its endeavours to develop its services better. There are many classification methods that the entity can follow, as it is possible to add classifications for the services affiliated to each of  the sub-services that are requested by the customers and the public benefit services as follows:\n\n1According to the service structure (main or subsidiary), whereby the main service  is:  a  set  of services provided by the entity, in which a set of subservices with which it shares many characteristics are  included,  and  the sub-service  is:  a  service provided by the entity at the express request of the customer, and it is recognized by the customers and joins the main services.\n\n2According  to  the  customer  segments  benefiting  from  the  service (individuals,  business  sector,  government  entities).\n\n3According to the service integration (integrated, disintegrated), whereby  integrated  services  are services that the government entity provides through collaboration with another entity in the local, federal, semi-governmental, or private sector. Disintegrated services are services that the entity uniquely and exclusively provides to customers.\n\n4According  to  the  nature  of  the  service  (informational,  commercial, specialized, regulatory, legislative, etc.).\n\n5According to life experience (birth, education, marriage, death, etc.).\n\nWhat is the Policy for Naming Services?\n\nEntities must correctly name the services so  that  they reflect the value provided from the customer's point of view and not according to the nature of the procedures for that service. The following points should be taken into consideration  when  naming  the service:\n\n· The service name should be clear, uncomplicated, and reflect the nature of the service.\n\n· The customer's perspective must be taken into account,  as  the customer  will  be  the  one  applying for the service.\n\n· The final output provided to the customer must be clearly indicated in the service name.\n\n· The service name should not contain any misspellings.\n\n· The service name should not describe the service delivery process.\n\n· The service name should not contain abbreviations or punctuation.\n\n· The service name should not include more than one language.\n\nThe Naming of Main Services and Sub- services:\n\nWhen  naming  the  main  services,  the  following points must be taken into account:\n\n· The main service name should be short and comprehensive.\n\n· The main service name should express the group or package of services that falls under it.\n\n· The main service name should reflect the categorization of the services used.\n\nExample of main service name:\n\n'Vehicle Driving License Services'\n\nWhen naming the sub-services under the main service, the  following  points must  be  taken  into account:\n\n· Clarification of the action taken by the customer.\n\n· Clarification of the action taken by the entity.\n\n· Clarification of the final output to be expected of the service.\n\nExample of sub-service name:\n\n'Request to Issue a Driving License'\n\nThird: Evaluating the Internal Maturity of the Customer Experience Capabilities\n\nThe  entities  covered  by  the  Abu  Dhabi  Policy for  Effortless  Customer Experience are required to conduct an objective evaluation of the maturity level of their customer experience activities and practices  regularly and in accordance with the criteria outlined in this guide.\n\nThe maturity of the entity in relation to the customer experience is assessed  through  the  following  stages:\n\nFirst: Selecting members of the customer experience team who will receive specialized  training  in  the  maturity  criteria  and  evaluation  mechanism, using an electronic system for the evaluation process.\n\nThe entity's maturity assessment team is divided into two groups and the team is managed by the head of the assessment team.\n\nSecond: Starting the process of self-assessment of entity maturity, and this assessment is done based on the Abu Dhabi Framework for Effortless Customer  Experience,  using  the  digital  system  tool.  The  evaluation  is carried out through the following processes:\n\n· The evaluation process includes an evaluation of 4 main dimensions, under each of which fall evaluation questions related to the dimension. The evaluation question is answered and supported by evidence.\n\n· Each group in  the  self-assessment  team  completes the  assessment separately and chooses the score of the  assessment  based  on  the evidence provided and documented in the system.\n\n· After completing the self-assessment for each group, a meeting is held with the head of the assessment team to compare the results, solve any problems,  and  agree  on  the  final  result  in  case  there  are  any differences in the assessment results for each team.\n\nThird: External Validation\n\nA team from the Department of Government Enablement visits the entities to review the results of the self- assessment to verify that the results that have been developed are supported by sufficient evidence and to approve the results.\n\nFourth: Determining the current level of maturity of the entity\n\nBased on the outputs of the self-assessment process, the current level of maturity of the entity is scored from 0 to 4.\n\nFifth: Identify improvement initiatives\n\nBased on the outcomes of the entity's maturity assessment process, the necessary initiatives are identified to raise the maturity level to the desired level.\n\nStage1\n\nStage2\n\nStage3\n\nStage 4\n\nStage 5\n\nChoosing members of the maturity assessment team, composed of two groups, and equipping them with specialized training.\n\nConducting the CX maturity self-assessment\n\nExternal\n\nValidation\n\nDetermining the entity's current level of CX maturity\n\nIdentifying improvement initiatives\n\nFigure 6: The Hierarchy of the Stages of Assessing the Maturity of the Entity\n\nFourth: Customer Experience Priorities\n\nThe entities covered by this policy must prepare, document,  update,  and circulate  their  customer  experience  priorities  in  line  with  the  strategic aspirations of the Abu Dhabi government, and in accordance with what suits the nature of their work based on a comprehensive understanding of their internal and external environment. In addition, they must take into account the current and future needs and  expectations  of  customers, according  to  the criteria set forth in this guide.\n\nThe  Department  of  Government  Enablement  undertakes  the  tasks  of reviewing and approving the priorities of the customer experience for the entities covered by the Abu Dhabi policy for effortless customer experience and ensuring they align with the guidelines set forth in this guide.\n\nCustomer experience priorities must be guided by a set of basic elements as follows, and the entity can add other elements to enhance the priorities of its customer's experience.\n\n01 The Strategic Vision of the Customer Experience in Abu Dhabi\n\nThe entity's customer experience priorities must be aligned with the  future vision  of  the customer's experience in Abu Dhabi:\n\n'Towards an effortless customer experience'\n\n02. The Study of Institutional Strategic Context\n\nThe customer experience priorities must be guided by the purpose of the entity's existence and what  it  aspires  to  achieve,  by  studying  the law of establishing this entity and the entities to which it belongs, its vision and mission, its institutional values and strategic priorities in relation to improving  the  customer  experience.\n\nThis includes the need to review the list of services of the entity and its subsidiaries,  and  the  customer  segments  to  whom  these  services  are provided; aspects of linking these various services,  the  ways  of  providing them,  the  list  of partners in providing these services, whether from other government entities or from the private or semi-governmental sector, and the nature of their different roles.\n\n03 The Strategic Objectives and Performance Indicators Related to the Customer's Experience with the Entity\n\nThese are the long-term goals and performance indicators an entity seeks to  achieve  to  enhance  its customers' experience  to  align  with  the ambitions of the strategic vision of customer experience in Abu Dhabi.\n\nIt  is  presumed that these objectives are characterized by the following characteristics:\n\n· To be aligned with the strategic vision of the customer experience in Abu  Dhabi.\n\n· To be viable and ambitious at the same time. To be clear and measurable.\n\n· To be specific with a clear time frame.\n\n04 The Current Status of Customers' Perceptions and Service Performance\n\nThe  entity's  customer  experience  priorities  should  be guided by the customers' current perceptions in terms of the level of effort, satisfaction, quality  of services,  and  the  current  service  performance in terms of speed, ease of access, ease of availing the service, and the professionalism of  CX  agents.  This  is  because  these  data  represent  the  baseline from which  the  entity  will  start  to  achieve  its  ambitions.\n\n05 The Entity's Desired Level of Internal Maturity of Customer Experience Capabilities\n\nIt is the level that the entity aspires to reach in terms of the possibilities of the customer's experience.\n\n06 The Current Level of Internal Maturity of the Customer Experience Capabilities\n\nThis  is  based  on  the  results  of  the  self-assessment  according  to  the mechanism that was previously explained. It is also necessary to review the plans and initiatives of the customer's previous experience and to understand  their  success  factors  and  the  most  important  challenges.\n\nFigure 7: Customer Experience Priority Elements Summary\n\nTypes of Customer Experience Priorities\n\nThe customer experience priorities  by  the  entities  covered  by  the  Abu Dhabi policy for effortless customer experience are divided into two types:\n\nThe First Type: Service Initiatives\n\nThese  are  initiatives  that  are  completely  related  to  developing  priority services  that  can  be  identified  by  the  entity  with  internal  efforts  or determined by the Department of Government Enablement to be designed in  the  Service  Design  Lab.\n\nThese initiatives are identified through the design methodology used in Abu Dhabi and described in this guide.\n\nThese initiatives are directly aimed at improving service performance, such as  developing  channels  of  communication with customers, reducing service steps or the number of requirements, granting power to specific service providers, etc.\n\nIt usually focuses on solutions that have the greatest impact on improving the customer experience, which can be achieved in a relatively short time to provide an increasingly and continuously positive customer experience.\n\nThe  following  criteria  can  be  used  as  a  guide  when  defining  service initiatives:\n\nThe amount of positive impact on the customer's experience,  measured by the  potential  impact  on  reducing  the customer's effort  level  and increasing  satisfaction.\n\n· Ease  of  planning  and  implementing  which  is  measured  by  the availability of sources and resources needed to plan and implement the initiative, such as skills, techniques, time, etc.\n\nThe high priority services of the entity can be identified through a set of  criteria,  and  the most prominent of which are:\n\n· The volume of the current demand for the service: a study of the volume of demand for the service by determining the number of customers and transactions of the service  for  several  consecutive  years, through various service delivery channels.\n\n· The volume of future demand for the service: Here, changes in demand are observed  over  the  years,  seasons,  or different circumstances to understand the possibility of increasing the volume of demand for the service by the public through different channels.\n\n· Customers' perception: This is studied quantitatively by studying the level of effort, satisfaction, and service quality as seen by the customer or qualitatively by studying customers' complaints,  suggestions,  and observations  through  various  channels,  to understand the extent to which the service fulfils customers' current needs and future expectations.\n\n· Linking service improvement to other services: Studying the impact of improving this service on other services in the entity or its affiliated entities.\n\n· Focusing on a specific customer segment: Its strategic importance in the medium and long term.\n\nIt should be noted that what these standards mean  may  differ  from  one entity  to another, depending on the nature of the entity's work and the volume of services it provides. Accordingly,  the  criteria  for  the  highpriority services must be defined internally in the entity and agreed upon when preparing the priority- setting matrix.\n\nThe Second Type: Entity Initiatives\n\nThey are improvement initiatives at the level of the entity and do not target a specific service in and of themselves. They can affect a large number  of services positively  when  applied and contribute to the development of the customer's  experience  and  raise  the  level  of  maturity  of the customer's experience from the current level to the desired level. It can include developing work policies to facilitate the completion of transactions more effectively and easily, developing the skills of backend employees, introducing a queuing system, etc.\n\nFifth: Action Planning for Priority Improvement\n\nThe  entities  covered  by  the  Abu  Dhabi  policy  for  effortless customer experience  must  prepare, document, update, implement, and circulate action plans for their priorities, according to the instructions set forth in this  guide.\n\nThe  Abu  Dhabi  Digital  Authority  shall  provide  the  necessary  technical support  to  the  entities  covered  by  the  Abu  Dhabi  Policy  for  effortless customer experience to implement action plans and  digital  agreements, according to the instructions explained in this guide.\n\nSuccess Factors of Action Plans and Digital Agreements\n\nThe following points must be adhered to while developing action plans for priority improvements and digital agreements:\n\n· The correct preparation of action plans and digital agreements requires the involvement of all stakeholders (including the use of experts to provide necessary details) and should not rely on individual efforts.\n\n· Attention to the institutional impact of implementing the initiative and the changes it causes  to  systems,  people,  and  culture,  and this should be taken into account when planning and implementing the initiative.\n\n· Action plans must be flexible to be able to  adopt changes that may occur  during  the  implementation  period.\n\n· Action plans and digital agreements must be reviewed and approved by  relevant  leadership  members.\n\n· Action plans, digital agreements, and any  updates  must  be circulated to all concerned departments before starting the implementation process.\n\n· The  performance  of  action  plans  and  digital  agreements  during implementation must be monitored according to the periodicity that was  determined  for  the  review  process  to  verify  the  validity  and effectiveness  of  their  implementation.\n\n· In the event of any weakness or delay in implementation,  the  reasons behind  this  must be identified and discussed with the stakeholders in a  transparent  manner,  and procedures and recommendations that contribute to correcting the course must be established in cooperation with the stakeholders.\n\nWhat are the Components of Action Plans for Priority Improvement?\n\nThe following points show the main components of action plans for priority  service  improvement:\n\n· The general formulation of service challenges (for service initiatives) according to the service design methodology used in Abu Dhabi and described in this guide.\n\n· Actions (activities) to be taken to achieve the initiative.\n\n· Implementation  responsibilities  and  the  stakeholders  involved  in implementing each action/activity.  It  is  preferable  to  specify  them precisely to reflect who is actually responsible for the implementation of  each  step,  all  the  way  to  specific  people  or  groups  of  people  as teams.\n\n· Resources needed to implement the initiative including  the  expected cost,  required  techniques and skills, and others.\n\n· The relative weight of each activity or action in the initiative to simplify the project management process.\n\n· The time frame for implementing the initiative's actions and activities, whereby the time frame is acceptable and compatible with the nature of the initiative.\n\n· A  mechanism  of  follow-up  for  the  initiative,  the resources used in the follow-up, and the periodicity of the follow-up.\n\n· The objectives (outputs) required for all activities and actions of the initiative.\n\nSixth: Measurement\n\nThe Department of Government Enablement is responsible for determining, defining,  updating,  and  measuring customer experience indicators for the Abu Dhabi government, which ensure the achievement of Abu Dhabi Policy for  Effortless  Customer Experience.\n\nThe entities  covered  by  this  policy  shall  periodically  and  systematically measure  their  customer experience  indicators,  follow  up  their  results through all  channels,  take  appropriate  measures  to  ensure continuous improvement of the customer's experience, and submit reports in this regard to the Department of Government Enablement and provide it with the  necessary  data  and  statistics.\n\nHow to Measure an Effortless Customer Experience\n\nCustomer Experience performance is measured and monitored through three  types  of  measurements:\n\n01 Customers'  Perception  Measurements:  Customers'  perception measurements contain a set of main indicators, the most important of which are:\n\n· Customer Effort Score: It is an increasingly important measure in the government sector to express the amount of effort the customer has made to obtain the service.\n\nIt is measured through a questionnaire that is shared  with  customers,  in which  a  question  is  asked  about  the  effort  expended  in  obtaining  the service to be evaluated through a specific scale (1-5/7/10), and the lower the scale's result, the lower the effort.\n\n· Customer  Satisfaction  Score:  It  is  a  measure  that  expresses  the emotional  perception  of  the  customer  upon  receiving  the  service.\n\nIt is measured through a questionnaire that is shared  with  customers,  in which  a  question is  asked  about  the  customer's satisfaction with the service to be evaluated through a specific scale (1-5/7/10), and the higher the scale's result, the greater the satisfaction.\n\n· Customer Experience Index: It is an indicator that expresses customers' evaluation of a set of seven technical aspects of the service:\n\n1. The speed of obtaining the service\n\n2. Ease of access to the service\n\n3. Ease of obtaining the service\n\n4. Quality of service information\n\n5. CX agents' professionalism\n\n6. Customer privacy\n\n7. Appearance of service delivery environment\n\n02 Service Measurements: A set of internal indicators  that express the level of performance of the service delivery and the professionalism of  the  staff  responsible  for  providing  it.  The  following  indicators affect the effort that the customer makes to obtain the  service, and therefore  these  metrics  are considered important to the Abu Dhabi government:\n\n· Service Speed Scale: It is concerned with the time required to obtain the service from the time of starting the search for the service until it is fully obtained (from start to finish).\n\n· Ease of Use Scale: It is concerned with the procedures  necessary  to complete  the  service, the number of visits, steps, points of contact, and the documents required to complete the service.\n\n· Ease of Accessibility Scale: It is concerned with the amount of movement necessary for the customer to complete obtaining the service.\n\n· CX Agents Professionalism Scale: It is concerned with the skills that the customer experience employee possesses to support the  customer while obtaining the service.\n\n03 Customer  Experience  Capability Measurement:  It  expresses  the extent  of  the  maturity  of  the  customer  experience  capabilities in the entity, which are the capabilities of strategic direction, design, development, and delivery, according to the dimensions of  The International Model for Customer Experience in Government followed in the  Abu  Dhabi  government  CX  framework,  as shown in the  second section  of  this  guide.\n\nAdditional Measurements\n\n· Satisfaction measure with complaints closing procedures.\n\n· Mystery shopper indicator that measures the entity's commitment to implementing mystery shopper standards through analysis of mystery shopper studies of the customer's experience.\n\n· Commitment indicator to close complaints within the specified time.\n\n· The digital adoption index for government services to measure the extent to which customers  use  digital  channels,  and  it  is measured by finding the result of dividing the transactions provided through digital channels by the total number of transactions (digital and non-digital).\n\nDefining Customer Experience Indicators\n\nIt  is  necessary  to  create  a  card  for  each  of  the  customer experience indicators to unify the concepts related to it. The card can contain the following  information:\n\n· The indicator to be measured.\n\n· Index calculation mechanism\n\n· Calculation equation\n\n· Periodicity of indicator measurement/calculation\n\n· Periodic reporting to stakeholders\n\n· Those concerned with measuring and  calculating the indicator.\n\n· Those concerned with the results of the indicator.\n\n· Digital targets\n\n· Objective / strategic objectives related to it.\n\nSuccess Factor of the Customer Experience Measurement Process\n\n· It is necessary to monitor the extent to which performance indicators are being achieved on an ongoing basis and according to the periodicity that has been determined for the various performance indicators.\n\n· The results should be monitored and analysed on an ongoing basis, and the reasons should be studied when there are low or lower performance levels than the  target,  and  discussed  with  the  stakeholders  to determine  the  procedures  and  recommendations  that  contribute  to correcting the course of action.\n\n· It is necessary to write reports according to the specified periodicity and submit them to the leadership to understand the levels of the customer's experience, adopt recommendations, and take appropriate measures.\n\nSeventh: Governance of the Customer Experience\n\nThe Department of Government Enablement is responsible for defining and updating general customer experience standards through various channels, verifying levels of compliance with them, and implementing appropriate corrective  measures  in  this  regard.

Studying the service to be improved by identifying  the stakeholders, the  customer segments who benefit from the service, the methods of applying for the service, the systems used to complete the service, and the nature of the outputs.\n\n2. Understanding the different service challenges and the reasons behind these challenges.\n\n3. Studying  the  current  service  performance  using  quantitative  and qualitative  analysis  of  service  data.\n\nHow To Define Service Challenges\n\nThe design team typically engages in a range of activities that help them understand service challenges, for example:\n\n· Understand the customer's journey to obtain the service and analyse their different behaviour and sentiments  across the different touch points.\n\n· Review  customers' complaints  and  suggestions  to  obtain  effective information  about  the customer's needs.\n\n· Understand the actual drivers of customer behaviour to reach a deeper understanding of service challenges.\n\n· Understand the impact of employees and strategic partners on service performance.\n\nQualitative  Data\n\nQualitative data research helps service designers identify service challenges by identifying the true needs and desires of  customers. It also directs the efforts of service designers toward developing a deep understanding of customers' behaviours, expectations, pain, and motives.\n\nQualitative data research is of an exploratory nature and is concerned with collecting data through direct and indirect meetings with customers as individuals or groups.\n\nThe qualitative data collection tools and techniques used  by  designers and  researchers  vary,  and  the choice of data collection method affects the effectiveness of the research and exploration process to understand service  challenges.\n\nWhen  qualitative research is implemented  effectively, its results successfully  highlight  service challenges and lead to an understanding  of undiscovered  customer  needs  that  are  essential  inputs  to  the  design process.\n\nHere are some of the tools and techniques that can be used to collect qualitative data:\n\n· Open-ended questions in the questionnaires\n\n· Interviews with the customers\n\n· Focus groups.\n\n· Observational studies\n\n· Reference comparisons\n\nQuantitative Data\n\nQuantitative data collection tools and  techniques were used to obtain a general and statistical perception of the service challenges and the nature of the customer. Techniques for collecting quantitative data include:\n\n· Quantitative questionnaires\n\n· Quantitative observational studies\n\n· Experiments\n\nQuantitative data is essential for service designers because it:\n\n· Determines the service baseline.\n\n· Measures  the  progress  in  service  performance  after  implementing transformation  initiatives.\n\nDrawing a Customer Journey Map\n\nMapping the customer journey is an important process for understanding how customers interact with the service. This is done through:\n\n· Visually  recording  all  touchpoints  that  the  customer  goes  through when receiving the service which includes before, during, and after communicating  with  the  service  provider.\n\n· Analysing the customers' behaviours and interactions across the various touchpoints.\n\n· Taking into consideration all the scenarios that the customer may go through  or  the  different  customer  segments.\n\n· Taking into consideration all cases in which the customer may fail to apply for  the service,  and  the  necessary  steps  to overcome that.\n\nDefining Challenges\n\nThe main challenges of the service are defined by understanding all the information  collected  during  the  drawing  of  the  customer's  journey  or when  studying  the  quantitative  and  qualitative  data  of  the  service.\n\nIt  is  necessary that  the design  team  correctly frame the challenges by approaching  and  organizing  service  information  through  a  scientific approach. It is also necessary that the service challenges accurately reflect their  reality.\n\nFraming the service challenges must be:\n\n· Brief and clear\n\n· Based on real inputs and not based on hypotheses\n\n· Implementable across specific courses of action\n\nService Baseline\n\nIt is essential that the design team define  a baseline for the service during and when they have identified its challenges. The baseline can express the following measurements:\n\n· Number of affected customers/beneficiaries of the service\n\n· The number of service transactions\n\n· The carrying capacity of the delivery channels.\n\n· The current demand for the service\n\n· Customers' impressions of the service\n\n· Employee productivity\n\n· The unit cost of the service\n\n· The total cost of the service\n\n· Service time\n\n· The number of steps to provide the service\n\n· The number of documents required to obtain the service.\n\nThird: Ideation\n\nThe  entities  covered  by  the  Abu  Dhabi  policy  for  effortless  customer experience must use the methods and tools of sequential creative thinking to  propose  appropriate  ideas  and  scenarios  for  the  development of services,  strategies,  and  priority services while taking into consideration the opinions of customers and in cooperation with strategic partners from the public and private sectors. This shall be done in a manner that harnesses modern and pioneering technologies to serve customers.\n\nThe entities covered by this policy must also launch strategic initiatives that transform strategic and priority services to become easy, accessible, and effortless, taking into account the fulfilment of the needs of all customer segments through various channels.\n\nThe Importance of Effective Idea Generation Sessions\n\nThe  importance  of  the  idea  generation  stage  lies  in  the  following points:\n\n· Forming an inclusive grouping of service designers,  stakeholders,  and customers with  the aim of offering solutions in a differentiated manner that explores a wide range of design alternatives.\n\n· Creating an open space for discussing, filtering, and constantly revising ideas.\n\n· Attaining  a  wide  range  of  ideas  that  service  designers  will  test  and prototype.\n\n· Providing an opportunity that brings together unique  perspectives, leading  to  comprehensive solutions with the help of an experienced supervisor.\n\n· Holding idea generation sessions to reveal unexpected aspects of the problem  that  need  further  investigation  and  help  move  the  team beyond  choosing  clear  solutions.  This  helps  in  stimulating  creative thinking so that a set of the most innovative ideas is reached and to eventually  proceed  to  the  prototyping  stage.\n\nThe Role of the Facilitator in the Idea Generation Sessions\n\nThe  process  of  generating  ideas  takes  place  through  holding  sessions headed by an experienced  facilitator who is keen to achieve the desired goal by the end of the session.\n\nResponsibilities of the facilitator during idea- generation sessions:\n\n· Effectively  overseeing  sessions  by  understanding  and managing diverse  teams,  personalities,  and  dynamics.\n\n· Ensuring the involvement of the various elements that create the ideal environment  and  mindset,  and  the  appropriate  state  to  achieve maximum  benefit  from  the  participants  in  generating  ideas  and increase  the  chance  of  achieving  a  productive  session.\n\n· Exploiting environments that stimulate the flow of creative ideas; there is nothing better than participating in an idea generation session that takes you literally and figuratively out of the ordinary. Research shows that  inspiring  spaces can have a significant impact on  the  creative state of a design team, so it is advised to avoid holding sessions in the usual places such as meeting rooms. Instead, a stimulating environment that helps foster innovative ways of thinking should be chosen.\n\n· Providing  a  safe  environment  for  open  and  creative  thinking.  An experienced facilitator ensures a comfortable environment in which participants  have  the  ability  to  exchange  innovative  ideas  and  ask thought-provoking  questions.\n\nThe Most Important Tasks of the Idea Generation Sessions\n\nThe most important tasks of the idea generation sessions are:\n\n· Generate and evaluate ideas.\n\n· Choose the feasible solutions/initiatives for application.\n\nImportant Guidelines for Brainstorming\n\nThe most important tasks of the idea generation sessions are:\n\n· This stage is carried out in a smooth manner to facilitate the creative thinking  process and to allow all stakeholders to contribute to sharing their ideas and solutions, no matter how small or large they are.\n\n· Certain  tools  and  techniques  can  also  be  used  during  this  stage  to facilitate creative  thinking (such as brainstorming or brainstorming using  games)  and  other  tools.\n\n· It is important to prepare for the process of brainstorming by providing an appropriate environment that motivates all participants to propose solutions and creative ideas without hesitation.\n\n· The  process  of  brainstorming  should  also  be  prepared  by  using techniques that have proven to be effective in motivating participants to  propose as  many  ideas  as  possible  and  assure  ideas  flow  in a smooth  and  creative  way.\n\n· It is essential to focus on the challenges agreed upon in the previous phase of the design methodology to ensure that the idea- generation sessions are effective, and their objectives are achieved. This is to make sure that the ideas put forward are directed in the right context.\n\n· It  is  also  very  important  to  manage  the  sessions  to  ensure  that all the  ideas  put  forward  are  taken  into  account  and  to  give  equal opportunities to all participants to express their opinions and ideas on how to overcome the challenge that was  reached and agreed upon in the  previous  stages.\n\n· It is important to avoid rejecting the ideas presented  by  the  team, encouraging the team to put forward different ideas, and removing any feeling of hesitation or fear of participation.\n\n· Always keep a record of the ideas and interventions  that  are  put forward. This contributes to understanding the overall perception of the ideas and solutions presented.\n\n· It is also important to encourage the team to generate a vast number of  ideas  because  the quantity of ideas at this stage is more important than their quality.\n\nEvaluation of Ideas and Selection of Initiatives\n\nThe brainstorming step ends with a long list of potential solutions that the design team has agreed  that their implementation would contribute to addressing the challenges identified in the previous design stages.\n\nThis step aims to study and purify this long list and reduce the number of alternatives by defining and evaluating solutions that have practical and scientific strength to be further developed and enriched.\n\nThis  step  is  characterized  by  repetition  until  the  team  reaches  an agreement on the solutions selected for implementation. Typically, during this step, the team:\n\n· Applies a specific evaluation matrix that studies the extent to which the  proposed  solutions  address  service  challenges  and  the  extent to which the proposed solutions are easy to implement. It is usually advised to start with the easiest solutions and then gradually apply more complex solutions to achieve quick success for the service and prepare  the  work  teams  and  resources  needed  for  more  complex solutions  that  require  more  time  and  resources.\n\n· Conducts rapid prototyping to experiment with different solutions.\n\n· Applies  a  series  of  tests  to  improve  the  proposed  solutions  in preparation  for  their  selection.\n\nFourth: Visualize the Future State of the Customer's Experience\n\n· It is necessary to reimagine the customer experiences when obtaining the service after implementing the improvement initiatives that were agreed upon in the previous stages.\n\n· This step should be implemented with a balanced consideration of the involved customer segments.\n\n· The future customer experience should be visualized from start to end including all customer touchpoints, required, documents, etc.\n\n· It is necessary to identify the most vital metrics for the future customer experience so that their performance is monitored periodically.\n\n· The future customer experience should be visualized across all possible channels including emerging channels, such as text messages, social media, and online chats.\n\nNOTES\n\nAbu Dhabi Effortless Customer Experience Guide\n\n5\n\nTHE THIRD CHAPTER\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nThis section aims to provide additional instructions explaining the details of implementing the development dimension, in addition to the following sub-dimensions:\n\nFirst  - Testing\n\nSecond  - Deployment\n\nAfter completing the service development phase, it is necessary to prepare for its launch to the public.  However,  the  launch  requires  a  lot  of preparation and planning  to  ensure  a stable  integrated  service  that  provides  an  effortless experience for customers without any interruption.\n\nIn  this  sense, entities included in the Abu Dhabi  policy for effortless customer experience must comprehensively,  accurately,  and  continuously test strategic and high-priority services in their new form before and after their launch. This is to ensure that they comply with all launch requirements  through  appropriate service  delivery channels, digital and non-digital, in  coordination  with  all stakeholders.\n\nWhat are the Dimensions of Service Testing Before Deployment?\n\nThis model provides checklists for the  service before its launch. These checklists include several fundamental dimensions related to service delivery channels.\n\nEntities can make use of these lists to verify the performance of the service before releasing it to the public, which includes.\n\n· User interface criteria such as browsing, searching, ordering, applying for service, logging in and out of the app, etc.\n\n· Information security criteria\n\n· Ease of application criteria\n\n· Information quality criteria\n\n· Service design criteria.\n\n· CX agent's criteria\n\nIn the next page you will find The Pre-Launch Service Criteria Test:\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nFirst: Website User Interface Audit Form\n\nSecond: Smart Application User Interface Audit Model\n\nSecond: Smart Application User Interface Audit Model\n\nSecond: Smart Application User Interface Audit Model\n\nSecond: Smart Application User Interface Audit Model\n\nSecond: Smart Application User Interface Audit Model\n\nSecond: Smart Application User Interface Audit Model\n\nSecond: Smart Application User Interface Audit Model\n\nSecond: Smart Application User Interface Audit Model\n\nSecond: Smart Application User Interface Audit Model\n\nSecond: Smart Application User Interface Audit Model\n\nSecond: Smart Application User Interface Audit Model\n\nSecond: Smart Application User Interface Audit Model\n\nSecond: Smart Application User Interface Audit Model\n\nThird: Smart Application and Website Security and Information Standards\n\nThird: Smart Application and Website Security and Information Standards\n\nFourth: Website Ease of Use Standards\n\nFourth: Website Ease of Use Standards\n\nFifth: Customer-Centric Smart Application Ease of Use Standards\n\nFifth: Customer-Centric Smart Application Ease of Use Standards\n\nNOTES\n\nAbu Dhabi Effortless Customer Experience Guide\n\n6\n\nTHE FORTH CHAPTER\n\nDELIVERY\n\nThis  section  provides  additional  model  states that explain the implementation of the broad delivery  dimension  and  its  component  subdimensions:\n\nFirst  - The Customer\n\nSecond - The CX Agents\n\nThird -\n\nThe Relationship\n\nHow are Customers Segmented?\n\nThe segmentation of customers is the first and most important step that helps entities understand and manage their relationship with customers. This  process  helps  entities  understand  the  needs  of  various  customer segments and makes it easier to  reach them.\n\nIt is possible to divide the customer base into groups or segments according to distinctive characteristics  so  that  customers  of  each  segment  are similar in specific characteristics such as demographic, behavioural, or  social  characteristics,  as  well  as others.\n\nClassifying customers according to defined characteristics allows entities to target each of these groups to ensure that the needs and expectations of its customers are met.\n\nCustomers can be differentiated and categorized on  a  set  of  basic characteristics,  examples  of which are demonstrated below:\n\nFigure 8: Example of Classification of Customers by Characteristics\n\nWhat are the Main Criteria for Service Delivery?\n\nThis dimension provides fundamental and essential criteria to be considered when  delivering  services  to  customers  through  the  various  channels provided by the entity. It serves as a reference that helps the entity and its employees respond quickly and effectively to its customers to maintain a high level of professionalism during service delivery across all delivery channels.\n\nThese  standards  are  central  to  creating  a  holistic  customer  experience through a focus on various dimensions that reflect the quality-of-service delivery.\n\nService delivery standards are based on the following service quality standards:\n\n· The speed of service delivery\n\n· Accessibility of the service\n\n· Professionalism of staff\n\n· Ease of service completion\n\n· Quality of service information\n\n· Customer privacy\n\n· The service delivery environment\n\n· Health and safety\n\nWhat are the Criteria for Service Delivery at Service Centres (Which Requires the Physical Presence of the Customer)?\n\nPersonal interaction with customers requires the customer to be physically available at the service centres provided by entities.
