It  explains  the  recommended  approach  and  best  practices  for procurement operations.\n\nFigure 1: Procurement Framework\n\nSTANDARDS\n\nGUIDELINES\n\nDefinition of the Procurement\n\nThe Procurement is the support function that ensures identification, sourcing, and access to optimal goods, services and projects that the government entities and its End-users require to fulfil their objectives.\n\nThe Procurement exists to explore supply market opportunities and to ensure optimal implementation of the sourcing strategies that deliver the best possible supply outcomes for the government entity.\n\nThe Procurement adds value and helps the government entity accomplish its objectives by deploying a systematic, disciplined approach  to evaluate and  address its needs  collaboratively.  The Procurement  is  executed  through  a  series  of  activities  spanning  entire  supply  cycle  from  the understanding of requirements and evaluating the need for them, through identifying and analysing potential  supply  options,  up  to  contracting  with  Suppliers  and  fulfilment  of  contracts.  The Procurement runs continuously with ongoing management of relationships with the End-users, the Legal and the Finance, monitoring supply contracts and performance of Suppliers.\n\nCore Principles\n\nThe  Core  Principles  define  key  values  and  approaches  for  the  effectiveness  of  the  Procurement. The  Procurement  Practitioners  of  the  government  entity  and  every  supplier  engaged  by  it  in procurement  operations  must  adhere  to  the  Core  Principles  when  representing  the  government entity.\n\nThe Procurement Framework establishes the following ten integrated Core Principles:\n\nA Ability\n\nDevelop  procurement  workforce  with  right  capacity,  capabilities and knowledge ensuring professionalism while providing attractive, competitive career options\n\nB Accountability\n\nSupport accountability through the establishment or enhancement of authorities and ensure internal and external control mechanisms are coordinated and integrated into procurement operations\n\nC Digital\n\nPromote  digital  technologies  and  facilitate  their  adoption  and development  by  enabling  access  to  innovations  and  emerging digital solutions\n\nD Effectiveness\n\nDrive cost-effectiveness and improvement in performance of the Procurement  through  economies  of  scale,  specialisation,  and continuous assessment\n\nE Excellence\n\nDeliver  efficiency  and  achieve  greater  value  for  money  and  high level of control through the development of streamlined processes and tools\n\nF Fairness\n\nFacilitate access to procurement opportunities for potential Suppliers  through  establishing  a  fair  regulatory  framework  and implementing transparency and open-door attitude\n\nG Integration\n\nSupport integration of the Procurement with relevant organisational  functions  within  the  government  entity,  ensuring services delivered are comprehensive and a seamless flow of operations is maintained\n\nH Integrity\n\nPreserve high standards of integrity and neutrality in the Procurement  through  the  implementation  of  standards,  code  of business ethics and internal controls\n\nI Sustainability\n\nEnsure continuity and stability of supply through the integration of risk  management  practices  and  the  establishment  of  control mechanisms in procurement operations making them sustainable\n\nJ Transparency\n\nEnsure an adequate degree of transparency by allowing free access to procurement information, compliance with applicable legislations, and promoting fair treatment of Suppliers\n\nCode of Business Ethics\n\nArticle (1): Objectives and Scope of the Code of Business Ethics\n\n1.

The Procurement  is  executed  through  a  series  of  activities  spanning  entire  supply  cycle  from  the understanding of requirements and evaluating the need for them, through identifying and analysing potential  supply  options,  up  to  contracting  with  Suppliers  and  fulfilment  of  contracts.
