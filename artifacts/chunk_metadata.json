Procurement Benefits calculation principles\n\nProcurement Benefits can be calculated after acceptance of a final, binding offer from one or more Supplier(s) and the acknowledgment of offer conditions (with written confirmation, Letter of Intent, contract amendment, etc.).\n\nBenefits implementation costs (one-time investments) are excluded from the benefits calculation.\n\n1.4.3 Calculation Methodologies\n\n1.

In the face of this growing threat landscape, entities need to adopt practical measures to defend their critical information and information infrastructure against their most critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threats. To this end, a risk-based approach provides entities with a pragmatic mean to identify their most critical vulnerabilities that could expose them to risks, and develop corresponding appropriate treatments.\n\nAdopting a risk-based approach ensures that security controls are instituted in accordance with current risk assessments commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the impact that could result if critical information assets are compromised. The risk-based approach briefly outlined in these Standards summarizes a systematic methodology for identifying, estimating, evaluating, and treating identified entity-level risks.

The entity's monitoring and review processes should encompass all aspects of the risk management process, including the risk criteria, the identified assets, threats, risks, risk treatment options and security controls.\n\nACTIVITY 8: RISK COMMUNICATION AND CONSULTATION\n\nCommunication and consultation with key stakeholders should take place during all stages of the risk management process. Therefore, plans for communication and consultation should be developed at an early stage. These should address issues relating to the risk itself, its causes, its consequences (if known), and the measures being taken to treat it. Effective external and internal communication and consultation should take place to ensure that stakeholders and those accountable for implementing the risk management process understand the basis on which decisions are made, as well as the reasons why particular actions are required.\n\n5.5\n\nAPPLICABILITY OF CONTROLS\n\nThe concept of Applicability relates to the identification of security controls for treating entity-specific risks as outlined in [Step 5] of the risk assessment process described above (section 3.2).\n\nThe security controls included in these Standards are developed to treat a typical entity risk profile developed based on benchmark risk registers",

While this common risk profile is widely applicable to implementing entities, NESA recognizes that entity risk profiles do differ based on their specific business and operational context. Given these differences, not all security controls provided in these Standards might be applicable to all entities. Therefore, these Standards require that the identification of the security controls be based on an entity risk assessment resulting in applicable security controls for the treatment of identified risks.\n\nPrior to performing the risk assessment process, an entity should consider all security controls to be applicable. However, an individual entity may exclude some security controls on the basis of the risk assessment outcomes, provided that adequate justification is submitted to NESA.\n\nMoreover, certain security controls included in these Standards represent requirements for instituting foundational IA capabilities within an entity, and as such, are considered \"Always Applicable\".

Even with automated log analysis tools, human expertise and intuition are often required to identify and understand attacks.\nRELEVANT THREATSAND VULNERABILITIES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \u2022 Unauthorized access \u2022 Tempering with information systems \u2022 Backdoor or commandandcontrol\n[/TABLE]\n\nH\n\n;\n\nH\n\n[TABLE]\n          0                                                                      1                                                                                                                                                                     2                                                                                                                                                                     3\n     T3.6.1                                        MONITORING POLICYAND PROCEDURES                                                                                                                                       MONITORING POLICYAND PROCEDURES                                                                                                                                                PRIORITY APPLICABILITY\n    CONTROL The entity shall establish a monitoring policy and related procedures.

Such logging should be activated, with logs sent to centralized logging servers. Firewalls, proxies, and remote access systems (VPN, dial-up, etc.) should all be configured for verbose logging, storing all the information available for logging in the event a follow- up investigation is required. Furthermore, operating systems, especially those of servers, should be configured to create access control logs when a user attempts to access resources without the appropriate privileges. To evaluate whether such logging is in place, an entity should periodically scan through its logs and compare them with the asset inventory in order to ensure that each managed item actively connected to the network is periodically generating logs. Analytical programs such as SIM/SEM solutions for reviewing logs can provide value, but the capabilities employed to analyze audit logs are quite extensive, including, importantly, evenjust a cursory",

To verify that users with high-privileged accounts do not use such accounts for day-to-day web surfing and e-mail reading, security personnel should periodically gather a list of running processes to determine whether any browsers or e-mail readers are running with high privileges. Such information gathering can be scripted, with short shell scripts searching for a dozen or more different browsers, e-mail readers, and document editing programs running with high privileges on machines. Some legitimate system administration activity may require the execution of such programs over the short term, but long-term or frequent use of such programs with administrative privileges could indicate that an administrator is not adhering to this control.

Some enterprises have also found commercial services using remotely managed scanning appliances to be effective. To help standardize the definitions of discovered vulnerabilities in multiple departments of an entity or evenacross entities, it is preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that measure security flaws and map them to vulnerabilities and issues categorized using one or more of the following industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration, and platform classification schemes and languages: CVE, CCE, OVAL, CPE, CVSS, and/or XCCDF. Advanced vulnerability scanning tools can be configured with user credentials to log in to scanned systems and perform more comprehensivescansthancanbeachievedwithoutlogincredentials.The frequency of scanning activities, however, should increase as the diversity of an entity's systems increases to account for the varying patch cycles of each vendor.

The list of threats types are aggregated from benchmark risk registers and mapped to mitigating controls to assist implementing entities during their risk assessment process.\n\nOverall, a number of security controls are needed to mitigate specific threat types given the complex nature of the threats. As such, threat types along with their corresponding mitigating controls are outlined in Table 9 below.\n\nTABLE 9: MAPPING OF THREATS TO CONTROLS\n\n[TABLE]\n       0                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2\nCATEGORY                                                                                                                                        THREATTYPE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          CONTROLNUMBERSOF MITIGATINGCONTROLS\n MALWARE Send Data to External Site/Entity BackdoororCommand and Control Disable or interfere with security controls System / Network Utilities RAMScraper M3.3.3; M4.4.3; T1",
