Introduction\n\n1.1. Introduction to the Procurement Manual\n\n1.1.1 Purpose of the Procurement Manual\n\nThe Procurement Manual provides operational procedures to the Procurement practitioners. It reinforces the Procurement Standards, the Procurement Charter, and the Procurement Delegation of Authority (PDoA), giving a more detailed explanation of their application.\n\n1.1.2 Scope of the Procurement Manual\n\nThe Procurement Manual applies to all procurement activities conducted by the government Entities and the Government Procurement Office (GPO). The Executive Council (EC), or a relevant body authorised by the EC, may exclude an Entity from the application of the Procurement Manual. The Procurement Manual covers all relevant procurement processes and serves as the operational framework.\n\n1.1.2.(I) List of Exemptions\n\nThe Procurement Manual does not apply to:\n\na) Staff salaries and benefits\n\nb) Direct employment contracts or the engagement of individual experts which cannot be subject to tender\n\nc) General and administration expenses for non-predefined technical specifications, electricity, water, utilities, accommodation rentals provided to the employees and governed by the housing policies, professional and non-professional bodies' subscriptions, fee paid to organisers of conferences/exhibitions\n\nd) Agreements among government Entities or with international professional bodies for the purposes of research/collaboration/promotions\n\ne) Sponsorships and grants\n\nf) Purchase of artworks, artifacts, and associated ancillary expenses\n\n8) Copyrights license fees except where there is a contractual obligation to purchase goods, services or projects\n\nReimbursement of adhoc expenses incurred during travel (below Petty Cash threshold).\n\nMandatory or Regulatory fees (such as court fees, duties and taxes, bank fees etc.)\n\nAny other exceptions approved by the Executive Council (EC)\n\n1.1.3 Structure of the Manual\n\nThe structure of the Procurement Manual is aligned to the Procurement Capability Model (refer to Figure 1.3.1):\n\na) Level 1Procurement capabilities are classified into Strategic, Tactical, Operational, and Support capabilities.\n\nb) Level 2 -Each procurement capability includes one or more procurement process group.\n\nc) Level 3 -Each procurement process group consists of procurement processes.\n\nImportant Note: All procurement processes must be executed in line with the Procurement Standards.\n\nProcurement process groups are covered in the manual as per the following structure:\n\n1. Overview\n\n2. Details of level 3 Processes\n\ni. Scope and Purpose\n\nii. Procedures and Methodologies\n\niii. Roles and Responsibilities\n\n3. Work Aids — Forms and Documents\n\n4. RACI Matrix\n\nWork Aids — Forms and Documents section is only provided where applicable. Best practice templates of these work aids are issued and maintained by the GPO. Entities may either use the templates provided by the GPO, or use another approved template covering required elements.\n\nProcurement process maps, lists of tables and figures, and glossary of terms and definitions are covered in Appendix.\n\nProcurement practitioners reading this manual should consider the following points:\n\na) Key roles and functions are covered in the Procurement Manual in bold Italic (e.g., Sourcing Specialist, Tendering Committee, Contract Administrator etc.).\n\nb) Key business terms and keywords are covered in the Procurement Manual in Upper Case and defined in the Glossary (e.g., Negotiations Team, Common Category, Entity Specific Category, etc.).\n\nc) Key documents are covered in the Procurement Manual in 'single quotes' (e.g., 'Supplier Segmentation Report', 'Sourcing Strategy', 'Category Strategy', etc.).\n\nd) Supplier Master Data Management process group is executed entirely by Government Procurement Office (GPO) using \"SAP Ariba\". For this process group, key SAP Ariba terms, roles, statuses, templates, etc. are covered in the Procurement Manual in \"double quotes\" (e.g., \"Supplier Manager\", \"General Registration Questionnaire\" etc.).\n\ne) Matters critical from a feasibility or compliance perspective are highlighted as Important Note (e.g., Important Note: All Procurement processes must be executed in line with the Procurement Standards).\n\nf) Reference to other documents or sections within the Procurement Manual are highlighted as underlined italics (e.g., Please refer to Section 2.5.3.(Il) for the details of the 'Supplier Development and Collaboration' processes).\n\n1.2 Procurement Operating Model\n\nThe Procurement consists of the Government Procurement Office (GPO) and Entity Procurement. The Procurement Operating Model provides mandate, empowerment, and responsibilities of the Government Procurement Office (GPO) and Entity Procurement.\n\nFigure 1.2.1 Procurement Capability Model\n\nThe Government Procurement Office (GPO) is established to fulfil the following objectives:\n\na) Acting on behalf of the Entities to consolidate demand for achieving economies of scale. The GPO is authorized to manage and execute sourcing for Common Categories.\n\nb) Providing shared services such as Supplier Registration, Item Master Management, User Master Management, and Training.\n\nc) Maintaining the Procurement Framework ensuring a standardized and efficient way of working of the Procurement.\n\nd) Developing and operating the information technology platform for government procurement (eGate).\n\ne) Running market development initiatives and managing partnerships with the private sector in coordination with the relevant authorities.\n\nEntity Procurement is responsible for procurement of the Entity-Specific Categories including sourcing, contracting, ordering, and managing Supplier performance. The Entity Procurement utilizes the shared services provided by the GPO.\n\nThe GPO engages stakeholders from the Entities and dedicated Finance, Legal or other resources as needed for procuring Common Categories. The Entity Procurement engages End-Users and dedicated Finance, Legal or other resources for procuring Entity-Specific Categories.\n\n1.2.1 Category Classification\n\nClassification of a category as a Common Category or an Entity-Specific Category depends on the category spend value and its commonality across Entities. A category that is procured by five or more Entities may be considered as a Common Category.\n\nFigure 1.2.2 Common vs. Entity Specific Categories\n\n1.2.2 Category Taxonomy\n\nCategory taxonomy refers to a hierarchical assignment of goods/services. In line with global best practices, UNSPSC (United Nations Standard Products and Services Code) taxonomy is recommended to be adopted by GPO and Entity Procurement. UNSPSC is a four-level taxonomy with each record represented with an eight-digit number and unique name, illustrated below:\n\nFigure 1.2.3 UNSPSC Categorizations\n\nThe four primary levels of the UNSPSC are Segment, Family, Class, and Commodity. Each level is identified by two digits, that constitute together an overall eight-digit code.\n\nStandard categorization of goods/services/projects may be used for:\n\na) Consolidation of demand requirements\n\nb) Development of 'Category Strategy'\n\nc) Segmentation of Suppliers, and\n\nd) Identification of Supplier risk profiles.\n\nBest practice templates provided for these processes already include UNSPSC taxonomy. All Abu Dhabi DED activities are mapped to Level 2 UNSPSC categories. A comprehensive 'DED-UNSPSC Mapping Report' is provided in Section 2.2.3 for reference.\n\n1.3.

Baseline Spend\n\nBaseline Spend is the foundation of the Procurement Benefits calculation. It is the value of addressable spend against which any benefit is measured. Establishing a baseline is the first step in the Procurement Benefits calculations process.\n\n2. Classification of Procurement Benefits\n\nProcurement Benefits can be classified into Cost Reduction, Cost Avoidance, and Cash Impact. Details of the same are provided below:\n\n[TABLE]\n                                                                                                    Cost Reduction 'same for less'                                                                                                                                       Cost Avoidance 'avoiding future cost'                           Cash Impact\nDefinition • Benefits that directly reduce the cost base compared to the baseline • Costs can be one-offs or recurring/sustainable • Cost was not included in the original baseline • Action taken now to avoid future incremental costs • Could include initiatives that lead to cost reduction in the future • One - time impact of increased cash\n[/TABLE]\n\nTable 1.4.1 Procurement Benefits Classification\n\n[TABLE]\n                                                                                                                                                                        Cost Reduction 'same for less'                                                                                                                                                                            Cost Avoidance 'avoiding future cost'                                                                                      Cash Impact\n                                                      • Reduction in cost of software licenses resulting from optimization • A one-time saving such as a rebate or volume reduction in the prior year. • Consumption reduced because of increase in efficiency or optimization • Price increase as a result of external factors, e.g. an increase in regulatory minimum wage, is offset by a reduced agency fee mark-up Example • Cash impact outstanding payables with Supplier (increased 'Payment Terms') or decrease\nHard benefits (savings or additional revenue) vs Baseline Spend reduction year-over- spend particular to the cost avoidance initiative demand optimization) • Cost avoidance comparing the variance in                                                                                                                                • No increase in year-over-year relevant (e.g., demonstrated by volume and price.                                                          Measurement • • One - time demonstrated\n[/TABLE]\n\n1.4.2 General Principles\n\nFollowing general principles apply to the calculation of Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits:\n\n1. Baseline principles\n\nAn agreed baseline is required for Procurement Benefits calculations and must be signed-off by the relevant stakeholders from the End-User, the Finance and the Procurement.\n\nBaseline could be historic actuals (e.g., prior year spend, budgeted spend, etc.).\n\niii. The baseline must be supported by one or multiple data sets, such as Accounts Payable (AP) data, Purchase Orders (PO) data, Contracts data, etc.\n\nAn appropriate method to calculate the Baseline Spend should be determined for each type of procurement benefit.\n\n2. Procurement Benefits calculation principles\n\nProcurement Benefits can be calculated after acceptance of a final, binding offer from one or more Supplier(s) and the acknowledgment of offer conditions (with written confirmation, Letter of Intent, contract amendment, etc.).\n\nBenefits implementation costs (one-time investments) are excluded from the benefits calculation.\n\n1.4.3 Calculation Methodologies\n\n1. Baseline Spend\n\nBaseline Spend is based on two parameters and is calculated as following:\n\nBaseline Spend = Total Volume * Baseline Unit Price\n\nTotal volume may be known or unknown. However, two methods can be used for calculations to estimate volume, as detailed:\n\n[TABLE]\n                     Method           Situation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Method\nDemand Plan Forecast Volume   Forecast is known                                                                                                                                                                                                            • 100% of forecast volume for the specific spend area\n   Historic forecast volume Forecast is unknown • 50% of historic volume + (50% of historic volume * category demand growth forecast %) In general, previous year volumes are used as historic volumes; if this data is not available, the period that is used to calculate historic volume should be mentioned.\n[/TABLE]\n\nTable 1.4.2 Volume Estimation Methodologies\n\nBaseline unit price may be estimated using one of the following methodologies:\n\ni. Historic price baseline\n\nHistoric price baseline is relevant when the goods/services/projects were purchased previously (in last year). Below are the details of various methods to create a historic price baseline:\n\n[TABLE]\n                                                                                                 Price Method                                                                                                              Situation                      Method\n  Used where market is not volatile (applicable for components and traded items like office furniture, etc.). • Last actual paid price in the Purchase Order (PO), or • Contracted price, if last actual paid price is not available             Last Price Paid\n                        Used in case of a volatile market (applicable for e.g., 100% index-based commodities)                                                                                • Average Price paid over the last year               Average Price\nUsed in case of a volatile market (Commodities for which transparent and independent index are not available)                                            • Average Price of historical offers after clarification from the Suppliers Average quoted Market Price\n[/TABLE]\n\nTable 1.4.3 Historic Baseline Price Calculation Methodologies\n\nii. Comparable price baseline\n\nIf a certain goods/service has not been purchased previously, historic price baseline cannot be established. In such cases, the baseline price can be estimated using comparable goods/services/projects (identical or similar specifications) where the price is known. (e.g., estimating the baseline price for a car rental service by comparing it with similar services previously purchased by another Entity).\n\niii. New price baseline\n\nIf neither a historic nor a comparable baseline can be established, a new baseline can be developed based on the initial RFI or RFP/RFQ responses provided by the Suppliers. The baseline price will be calculated as an average of the approved initial quotes. Any price reductions received through follow-on RFP/ auction/negotiation is considered as benefits.\n\n2. Procurement Benefits\n\nAs illustrated in Table 1.4.1, Procurement Benefits are classified into three buckets:\n\ni. Cost Savings\n\nFollowing are the various Cost Savings scenarios:\n\na. Standard Method (last paid price — new price)\n\nThis method is used when the savings result from the difference between baseline and negotiated price. For example, when Suppliers are changed or when_ similar goods/services/projects are bundled, resulting in a better price per item. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (baseline price — negotiated price) * volume\n\nFree of charges Extra\n\nThese are the savings realized when contracts negotiated with Suppliers include 'extras' that have not been part of the goods/service offering of past purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = Savings from free of charge 'extra' per unit * volume\n\nFluctuating market price with market Index\n\nThis method of calculation is used when the cost savings can be attributed to a changing market index that results in a better future price (with respect to the market price). This method is applicable for commodities (crude oil, metals, Agri-commodities, etc.) where prices are linked to indices and change frequently. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = Forecasted spend with historical index value — forecasted spend with new index value\n\nd. Fluctuating market price without market Index\n\nThis method of calculation is used when there are no market price references available. There may be no good benchmarks to indicate the savings w.r.t the market. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Initial offer — negotiated offer) * expected volume\n\nVolume Rebate\n\nThis method of calculation is used when the Supplier offers rebates on volume or similar incentives, which have not been included in previous purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (new rebate per unit — old rebate per unit) * volume\n\nRe-engineered specification (substitution) / rationalization\n\nFor some goods/services/projects, the specification can be changed to reduce the price. New specifications examples may include (but not limited to) using black and white printers instead of coloured printers, using standard cars instead of high-end cars for rentals, and using standard event designs instead of specialized events. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Cost for original item/service — cost for substitute item/service) * volume\n\nIn-house vs. Outsourcing\n\nFor some categories, where services are provided in-house, outsourcing of services might be a viable option. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (In-house cost (i.e. labor cost + material cost + overhead cost) — purchase price) x volume\n\nLease vs. Buy\n\nFor some categories lease of goods might be a viable alternative to buying (or vice versa). To compare the savings between leasing and buying options for goods, the cost per one unit needs to be calculated and compared. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Cost of purchasing per unit -leasing cost per unit) * volume\n\nReduced Cost of Disposal\n\nAt the end of their lifetime, some goods (e.g., Laptop) may be recycled. These costs need to be considered to determine the actual price of a product. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = Historic cost for disposal — new cost for disposal\n\nii. Cost Avoidance\n\nFollowing are various Cost Avoidance scenario:\n\na. Demand reduction/yield improvement\n\nThis method of calculation is used when the volume of a defined goods/service has been reduced through active negotiations by Procurement, (i.e., demand control). Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Last volume — negotiated new volume) * last price\n\nb. Reduced cost of service\n\nThis method is used to calculate the cost reductions for service (e.g., reduced maintenance cost through introduction of preventive measures). Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Historic service cost — new service cost)\n\niii. Cash Impact\n\nFollowing are the various Cash Impact scenarios:\n\na. Inventory reduction\n\nThis method is used when the involvement of Procurement leads to a reduction of inventories (e.g., stock) and results in significant cost savings. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Old Inventory levels — New Inventory levels) x WACC\n\n(WACC — Weighted Average Cost of Capital)\n\nb. Payment term extension\n\nThis method is used when the involvement of Procurement results in a change of 'Payment Terms' and leads to a working capital improvement. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = Working Capital Improvement = Average monthly invoice from supplier (VAT included) * New Payment terms (in days) / 30 * WACC\n\n(VAT — Value added tax; WACC — Weighted Average Cost of Capital)\n\n1.5 Legislations applicable for Procurement\n\n1.5.1 Abu Dhabi Local Content (ADLC)\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Local Content Program aims to direct government spending towards the development of the local economy in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The tenders published by government entities must ask for the submission of the ICV Certificate, sponsored by the Department of Economic Development of Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe weight given to the local content must constitute 40% of the overall score allocated to the financial/commercial evaluation score. The program will encourage suppliers to participate in government tenders to increase their economic contribution in Abu Dhabi through Emiratization, Investments, and Locally procured goods and services.

Procurement Processes Groups\n\n2.1 Procurement Strategy\n\n2.1.1 Overview\n\n'Procurement Strategy' is a high-level document that states an Entity's approach to achieving its procurement objectives, executing its activities and key initiatives. It guides on allocation of resources and budget for strategic initiatives and aligns procurement activities with Entity strategy and Abu Dhabi Governmental initiatives.\n\nThe 'Procurement Strategy' is created with mid-to-long term perspective and updated yearly. Key elements of value proposition addressed by the 'Procurement Strategy' include (but not limited to):\n\na) Increased value to the Entity\n\nb) Improved efficiency and effectiveness\n\nc) Greater stakeholder alignment\n\nd) Enhanced external partnerships\n\nThe Head of Procurement is responsible for the creation of the Procurement Strategy. The Head of Procurement assigns key members from Procurement to create and monitor execution of the 'Procurement Strategy'.\n\n2.1.2 Details of Level 3 Processes\n\n2.1.2.(1) Create and Execute 'Procurement Strategy'\n\n1. Scope and Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this process is to create, approve, and execute 'Procurement Strategy'.\n\n2. Procedures and Methodologies\n\ni. Conduct Internal and External Analysis\n\nAssigned key members conduct internal and external analyses as follows, to develop a 'Procurement Strategy':\n\na. Analyse Procurement -The assigned key members conduct an analysis of the Entity Procurement on following aspects to identify procurement optimization initiatives:\n\na1. People\n\na2. Processes\n\na3. Technology\n\na4. Governance\n\nThis analysis leads to a better understanding the Procurement from the perspective of Operating processes, organizational excellence, and knowledge and_ information\n\nmanagement. Post this analysis, various models (such as SWOT analysis) can be utilized to identify the key competencies and major areas of improvement.\n\nb. Conduct Spend analysis -In addition to above, spend data is collated and analysed for additional optimization opportunities. This analysis provides insights into historical spend, Supplier base, and spend categories to identify the focus areas for improvement.\n\nc. Conduct Market analysis -Assigned key members analyse the evolution of markets, trends and conditions to assess their impact on the Procurement. The necessary data may be collected through primary and secondary sources. This data is updated over time, to maintain relevance. Various methodologies, such as Porter's five forces (industry rivalry, buyer power, Supplier power, threat to new entrant, substitution possibilities), TOWS (Threat, Opportunities, Weakness, and Strengths) and PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental) analysis may be used.\n\nd. Conduct Benchmarking -A 'Competitive Assessment', conducted through survey and benchmarking, may show Entity's strengths / weaknesses with respect to industry best practices.\n\nThe 'Procurement Strategy' addresses the areas of improvements and adjustments required to remain relevant with respect to the changes in the market.\n\nii. Develop 'Procurement Strategy'\n\nThe 'Procurement Strategy' includes the following:\n\na. Vision and Mission -The vision and mission of the Procurement is derived from the vision and mission of the Entity.\n\nb. Goals / Objectives -Based on the analysis done in previous sections, assigned members develop clear objectives for the Procurement. Following are few examples of objectives and associated guiding principles for the Procurement:\n\n[TABLE]\n                     Guiding Principles                                                                                                                                                                     Procurement Objective Examples\n Align to Abu Dhabi government strategy • Scale procurement capabilities to enable alignment with agenda of the Entity • Promote MSMEs and Emirati Entrepreneurs • Empower green procurement through awareness& specifications enhancement\nDeliver Processes and Cost Efficiencies                         • Reduce cycle time for procurement processes • Execute Strategic Sourcing to meet requirements at a competitive cost • Bring innovations and spend insights to the Entity\n                     Improve Governance                                                                                                                                                   • Enhance visibility and control on Entity spend\n[/TABLE]\n\nTable 2.1.1 Examples -Procurement Objectives\n\nc.

Create and Monitor 'Category Strategy'\n\n2. Create and Monitor 'Procurement Plan'\n\n2.2.2 Details of Level 3 Processes\n\n2.2.2.(1) Create and Monitor 'Category Strategy'\n\n1. Scope and Purpose\n\ni. The purpose of this process is to create, review, approve, and monitor 'Category Strategy'.\n\nii. 'Category Strategy' enables management of Procurement spend in groups of similar or related goods/services/projects, leading to consolidation and optimization opportunities.\n\niii. 'Category Strategy' is created periodically, preferably once a year, for:\n\na. All Common Categories\n\nb. Entity-Specific Categories contributing to the top 80% of the Entity spend\n\niv. A Sourcing Specialist/Lead may be assigned as the Category Manager to manage the category. The Category Manager is responsible for creation and monitoring of 'Category Strategy'.\n\n2. Procedures and Methodologies\n\ni. Conduct category analyses\n\na. Tocreate a 'Category Strategy', the Category Manager conducts following category analyses:\n\na1. 'Internal Category Profile'\n\nThe 'Internal Category Profile' is developed by spend analysis and insights from supplementary documentation (supplier contracts, PO). It includes details such as (but not limited to) category description, annual spend and volume, Supplier base, top 10 Suppliers by spend, and spend by sub-category. Each detail provided in the 'Internal Category Profile' must be supported by relevant analysis.\n\na2. External Market Analysis\n\n'External Market Analysis' includes details of the industry structure and Supplier market for the category. It includes details such as (but not limited to):\n\n|. Category Definition — includes description of the category, its characteristics and other relevant information\n\nll. Value Chain — includes graphical representation of activities/processes performed or undertaken to deliver the goods/services/projects\n\nIll. Demand Drivers — includes details regarding historic and expected demand, key demand segments, unit price and price movement, policies and other Govt. mandates that impact demand etc.\n\nIV. Supply Market Dynamics -includes details regarding market size, overall industry capacity, key Suppliers, market growth and trends, mergers and acquisitions, etc. It covers Porter's five forces analysis (buyer power, supplier power, threat to new entrants, substitutes, and industry rivalry).\n\nV. Cost Structure -includes details regarding Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) (including but not limited to unit cost, logistics, maintenance, warranty, insurance, wear and tear, administrative, taxes and overheads). TCO provides visibility on cost heads, helping estimate potential areas of cost improvement which can generate savings and spend optimization opportunities.\n\nVI. Supplier Landscape -includes details regarding key Suppliers, brands, products available in the geography.\n\nb. Various information sources can be used to develop 'External Market Analysis'. These sources may include (but not limited to):\n\nb1. Primary Sources\n\ne End-Users and buyers of goods/services/projects\n\ne Suppliers and industry associations\n\nb2. Secondary Sources\n\ne Internet searches and company-specific publications\n\n¢ Online databases and media sources\n\ne Specialist public sector organisations\n\ne Private-sector research organisations\n\nc. It is recommended that publicly available secondary sources are researched before conducting primary research. The Category Manager should explore paid market research reports only if publicly available secondary sources and primary sources are not sufficient.\n\nd. The Category Manager may either use the provided template for 'Internal Category Profile' and 'External Market Analysis' or another approved template covering required elements.\n\nii. Create 'Category Strategy'\n\na. The 'Internal Category Profile' and 'External Category Analysis' provide actionable insights that serve as inputs to the 'Category Strategy'.\n\nb. 'Category Strategy' should cover (but not limited to) following sections:\n\nb1. Category Segmentation\n\nCategory Segmentation depends on the following criteria:\n\n|. Criticality of the Category is determined by factors such as (but not limited to) impact on Entity's operations in case of unavailability, and critical factors such as Health, Safety and Environment.\n\nIl. Complexity of the Category defines the inherent nature of a category that is governed by several factors including (but not limited to) availability of Suppliers, market structure (monopolistic, oligopolistic, competitive etc.), ability to switch Suppliers, possibility of substitution, lead times and regulations governing the category.\n\nBased on above parameters, the category may be classified into the following segments:\n\nFigure 2.2.1 Category Segmentation\n\nb2. Strategic Levers\n\nBased on the Category Segmentation, category optimization and improvement strategies (and associated levers) are selected. These strategies (and associated levers) are divided into following areas:\n\n|. Usage and Innovation\n\nIl. Price\n\nIll. Process and Operational Efficiency\n\nIV. Risk and Sustainability\n\nb3. Initiatives and Execution Plan\n\nInitiatives are identified against various strategic levers and an execution plan is developed for each initiative.\n\nb4. Supplier Engagement Model\n\nThe engagement model suggests the level at which the Supplier should be engaged as illustrated below:\n\nFigure 2.2.2 Engagement levels\n\nb5. Develop Business Case\n\nBusiness case provides a quantitative estimate of the potential savings that can be achieved by executing all selected initiatives within a category/sub-category. The Category Manager may upload additional documents to support the business case calculations.\n\nc. The Category Manager may either use the provided template for 'Category Strategy' or another approved template covering required elements.\n\niii. Review and approve 'Category Strategy'\n\na. Completed 'Category Strategy', along with supporting documents, is reviewed by reviewers designated as per the PDoA.\n\nb. Reviewed 'Category Strategy' is approved by approvers designated as per the PDoA.\n\niv. Monitor 'Category Strategy'\n\na. The approved 'Category Strategy' is shared with the relevant stakeholders for execution. Initiatives identified in the 'Category Strategy' are implemented through various procurement process groups.\n\nb. Execution of 'Category Strategy' is reviewed periodically by the Category Manager. During each review, individuals assigned to execute 'Category Strategy' provide updated status of respective initiatives.\n\nc. Any modifications made to the 'Category Strategy' go through reviews and approval as per the PDoA.\n\nd. 'Category Strategy' is considered complete when all identified initiatives are executed. Completion of 'Category Strategy' is communicated to all relevant stakeholders.\n\n3.

Below is an illustrative example of contract hierarchy:\n\nContains elements common to multiple Entities e.g., pricing (3AED per apple), guarantees, overall terms and conditions\n\nContains elements specific to each Entity e.g., delivery locations (Corniche 1), authorized requesters, SLAs\n\nContains delivery request(s) issues by each Entity defining date(s), quantity etc. in line with the provisions on FA and call off contract.\n\ne.g., PO for entity 1 for 3 apples at 3AED each to be delivered at Corniche\n\nFigure 2.4.1: Master Agreement — Sub-agreement Hierarchy\n\ne) Stand-alone agreement is the most commonly used contract type, entered between an Entity and Supplier for specific requirements. The Stand-alone agreement is not part of contract hierarchy.\n\nf) A Contracting Specialist/Lead is assigned to execute CLM processes. For a contract against an Entity-Specific Category, the Contracting Specialist/Lead is assigned from the Entity managing the category. For a contract created against a Common Category, the Contracting Specialist/Lead is assigned from the GPO.\n\ng) Contract Administrators are End-Users assigned to execute the contract.\n\n2.4.2 Details of Level 3 Processes\n\n2.4.2.(1) Create and Publish Contract\n\n1.

Segment Suppliers\n\n2. Set Relationships with Selected Suppliers\n\n3. Evaluate and Manage Supplier Performance\n\n2.5.2 Details of the Level 3 Processes\n\n2.5.2.(I1) Segment Suppliers\n\n1. Scope and Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this process is to classify Suppliers into following pre-defined segments:\n\na. Strategic Suppliers — show potential of innovation and collaboration, have a proven track record, and are some of the highest spend Suppliers.\n\nb. Critical Suppliers — are critical to everyday operations and any failure by such Suppliers has a significant impact on the Entity's operations.\n\nc. Operational Suppliers — have contracted commitments that require operational tracking and delivery monitoring.\n\nd. Transactional Suppliers — have minimal contracted spend with the least impact.\n\nCommon Category Suppliers are considered as Strategic Suppliers.\n\niii. Segment Suppliers process is executed periodically, preferably once a year.\n\nWhile segmenting Suppliers, it is crucial to consider the contracted spend with each Supplier for the same period to maintain a fair comparison. Only Suppliers with contracted spend during the period of review may be considered for this process.\n\nAn SRM Specialist is assigned to segment Suppliers. To segment Suppliers catering to Common Categories, SRM Specialist is assigned from the GPO and to segment Suppliers catering to EntitySpecific Categories, SRM Specialist is assigned from the Entity managing the category.\n\n2. Procedures and Methodologies\n\ni. Complete 'Supplier Segmentation Report'\n\na. The provided 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Form' template is designed to segment Suppliers, based on following two parameters:\n\na1. Business Impact of the Supplier -implies how vital the Supplier is to business operations and future initiatives.\n\na2. Supplier Risk /Complexity -implies the dependence on the Supplier and ease of switching the Supplier, if required.\n\nHigher score implies higher business impact/complexity of the Supplier as illustrated below:\n\nFigure 2.5.1 Supplier Segmentation\n\nb. The assigned SRM Specialist shares the 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Form' with Category Managers to collate required scores for Suppliers specific to their category.\n\nc. In case of categories without assigned Category Managers, 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Form' is shared with Contract Administrators or End-Users.\n\nd. The assigned SRM Specialist collates various 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Form' received into the 'Supplier Segmentation Report' template provided.\n\ne. There should only be one 'Supplier Segmentation Report' for an Entity/GPO.\n\nii. Approve consolidated 'Supplier Segmentation Report'\n\na. 'Supplier Segmentation Report' is approved by approvers designated as per the PDOA.\n\niii. Implement Supplier Segment Strategy\n\na. Approved 'Supplier Segmentation Report' is shared with the relevant stakeholders for execution of Supplier Segment Strategy.\n\nb. Following are the elements of the Supplier Segment Strategy:\n\nThe Supplier Segment Strategy is executed across procurement processes as follows:\n\nc1. Contract Compliance — Please refer to Section 2.4.2. (Ill) for details of Manage Contract Claims/Penalties/Disputes process.\n\nc2. Performance Evaluation — Please refer to Section 2.5.2.(Ill) for the details of the Evaluate and Manage Supplier Performance process.\n\nc3. Supplier Risk Profiling — Please refer to Section 2.7.2.(I) for the details of the Profile Supplier Risk process.\n\nc4. Supplier Development and Supplier Collaboration — Please refer to Section 2.5.2.(II) for the details of the Set Relationships with Selected Suppliers process.\n\nd.

Scope and Purpose\n\ni. The purpose of this process is to create, get relevant approvals and issue PO to the Supplier. The Supplier also confirms the receipt of the PO as a part of this process.\n\nii. An approved PR leads directly to PO, if goods/services/projects requested in the PR are covered under an existing contract.\n\niii. An approved PR may also lead directly to PO, if the spend threshold of goods/services/projects requested in the PR is below 50,000 AED. In such cases, involvement of Procurement is not mandatory as long as the End-User has a minimum of 2 quotations.\n\niv. In case the source of supply or conditions of purchase for the requested goods/services/projects are not known, 'Sourcing Request' is created by the Procurement for execution of Sourcing.\n\nImportant Note: Approved PR is verified by the Procurement against existing contracts to identify if the requirement can be fulfilled without entering into new obligations.\n\n2. Procedures and Methodologies\n\ni. Create and Approve PO\n\na. A Purchase Order (PO) includes details such as description, quantity, price, discount, payment terms etc. required to fulfil the order.\n\nb. Multiple PR may either be consolidated into an aggregate PO or single PR may be split into multiple POs for the following reasons:\n\nb1. Same/Different Suppliers — Goods/services/projects requested in the PR are procured through one or multiple Suppliers.\n\nb2. Same/Different Ship to Address — Goods/services/projects requested in the PR are to be delivered across one or more locations.\n\nb3. Contracted vs Non-Contracted -Goods/services/projects requested in the PR may be partially fulfilled through an existing contract.\n\nc. APR may be converted into a PO directly, through an existing contract, or through sourcing and contracting processes. PO is created by the Procurement.\n\nImportant Note: An approved PR is not to be split into multiple POs to bypass approval authorities.\n\nd. Completed PO is approved by the approvers designated as per the PDOoA.\n\ne. Approved PO is shared with the Supplier.\n\n3.

Scope and Purpose\n\ni. The purpose of this process is to confirm acceptance of the goods/services/projects and create a receipt for the accepted delivery.\n\nii. The process includes quality inspection and management of return of goods to the Suppliers.\n\n2. Procedures and Methodologies\n\ni. Receive goods/services/projects and match against PO\n\na. The goods received by the End-User or the store/warehouse are reviewed to ensure that the quantity delivered and specifications match with the PO and the delivery documents.\n\nb. Based on the review, one of the following approaches may be taken:\n\nb1. Delivery of goods\n\n|. Delivery of goods is accepted by the End-User or store/warehouse if the quantity and specification match with that provided in the PO or are within acceptable tolerances specified in the PO.\n\nIl. Delivery of goods can be rejected completely or partially (e.g., % of goods delivered are not as per the specification in the PO). In case of partial or complete rejection, the discrepancy is communicated to the Procurement and the Supplier.\n\nIll. Depending on the reason for rejection, the Supplier either replaces the defective/damaged goods or delivers the missing goods.\n\nb2. Delivery of services/projects\n\n|. Delivery of services/projects is accepted by the End-User if the specification match with that provided in the PO or are within acceptable tolerances specified in the PO. The End-User provides inputs on delivery with respect to milestones, KPI's/SLA, timelines etc.\n\nll. Delivery of services/projects can be rejected completely or partially. In case of partial or complete rejection, the discrepancy is communicated to the Procurement and the Supplier.\n\nii. Create and approve Goods/Service/Projects Receipt\n\na. End-User creates Goods/Service/Projects Receipt reflecting the goods/services/projects accepted upon delivery or post inspection.\n\nb. In case of goods/services/projects with high value (as defined in the PDoA) the Entity may choose to form a committee to conduct the inspection.\n\nc. The Goods/Service/Projects Receipt is approved by the approvers designated as per the PDOA.\n\nd.

The Supplier Master Database contains unique record of each Supplier.\n\nc) This section explains the activities, decisions involved, documents and templates used, the outcomes, and the stakeholders involved in the Supplier MDM processes.\n\nd) The following Level 3 processes are included in the Supplier MDM process group:\n\n1. Initiate Supplier Request\n\n2. Register Supplier\n\nUpdate Supplier Registration Pw\n\nQualify/Disqualify Supplier\n\nIdentify \"Preferred\" Supplier oy\n\nDeactivate/Reactivate Supplier\n\ne) The Supplier Registration Team, at the Department of Government Support (DGS), is responsible for onboarding Suppliers and maintaining the Supplier Master Database.\n\nf) The Supplier MDM process group is enabled through the \"SAP Ariba Supplier Lifecycle and Performance (SLP) module\"\n\n2.8.1.(I) Supplier Classification\n\nThe onboarding process of a Supplier varies with the type of Supplier. Suppliers can be broadly classified into the following two categories:\n\n1. Abu Dhabi Suppliers (AD-DED)\n\nThis category includes Suppliers that operate in the Abu Dhabi & have a valid Abu Dhabi DED license.\n\n2. Non-Abu Dhabi Suppliers (Non-AD-DED)\n\nThis category includes Suppliers that do not have a valid Abu Dhabi DED license. Such Suppliers may further be classified into:\n\ni. Local Suppliers (UAE Mainland and Freezone)\n\nii. Foreign Suppliers\n\n2.8.2 Details of Level 3 Processes\n\n2.8.2.(I) Initiate Supplier Request\n\n1. Scope and Purpose\n\ni. The Supplier onboarding process starts with a valid \"Registration Request\".\n\nii. The purpose of this process is to create, review, and approve the \"Registration Request\" and ensure that Supplier records are not duplicated in the Supplier Master Database.\n\n2. Procedures and Methodologies\n\ni. Raise \"Registration Request\"\n\na. \"Registration Request\" and registration requirements change based on the Supplier classification, as illustrated below:\n\nb. AD-DED Suppliers raise a \"Supplier Self-Registration Request\" by opening the \"SAP Ariba Supplier Self-Registration Request link\" and completing and submitting the \"Self-Registration Request form\".\n\nc. NonAD-DED Suppliers request an Entity to raise an \"Entity Raised Supplier Request\", on their behalf. In such cases, the Entity user logs into \"SAP Ariba Supplier Entity-Request Page\", completes and submits the \"Entity Raised Request Form\", and uploads the required documents.\n\nd. The Entity user should validate the information provided by the Supplier before submitting the request and confirm that the business requirements which are met by the Non -AD-DED Supplier cannot be met by an AD-DED Supplier.\n\ne. The Entity user, while completing the \"Entity-Raised Request Form\" must confirm the expected spend with the Supplier. In case of Foreign Suppliers, this expected spend decides the attestation requirements.\n\nFigure 2.8.1 Supplier Classification\n\nii. Review and Approve \"Registration Request\"\n\na. The Supplier Registration Team Lead, upon receiving on the \"Registration Request\", assigns the request to a Supplier Data Management Specialist for review and approval.\n\nb. The Supplier Data Management Specialist reviews the \"Registration Request\" for duplication and validity of the information provided.\n\nc. If the \"Registration Request\" is unique and provided information is accurate, the Supplier Data Management Specialist approves the request and assigns himself/herself as the \"Supplier Manager\" for the Supplier. The \"Supplier Manager\" acts as the single point of contact for the Supplier during the registration and qualification processes.\n\nd. As soon as the \"Registration Request\" is approved, the Supplier receives an invitation to register with \"SAP Ariba Network\". This email includes the \"SAP Ariba Registration Link\".\n\ne. In case of Entity raised request, the Entity users is notified about the request status (approval/denied).\n\nf. Suitable communication channels are established to support Suppliers during the registration process. The Supplier Registration Team must only use these channels to communicate with the Suppliers. The channels set up are:\n\nFigure 2.8.2 Communication Channels\n\nThe \"Request Additional Info\" functionality is only active in \"SAP Ariba\" after the Supplier has completed and submitted \"Registration Questionnaires\". Hence it is not available during the Initiate Supplier Request process.\n\n3.

Below is an illustrative example of contract hierarchy:\n\nContains elements common to multiple Entities e.g., pricing (3AED per apple), guarantees, overall terms and conditions\n\nContains elements specific to each Entity e.g., delivery locations (Corniche 1), authorized requesters, SLAs\n\nContains delivery request(s) issues by each Entity defining date(s), quantity etc. in line with the provisions on FA and call off contract.\n\ne.g., PO for entity 1 for 3 apples at 3AED each to be delivered at Corniche\n\nFigure 2.4.1: Master Agreement — Sub-agreement Hierarchy\n\ne) Stand-alone agreement is the most commonly used contract type, entered between an Entity and Supplier for specific requirements. The Stand-alone agreement is not part of contract hierarchy.\n\nf) A Contracting Specialist/Lead is assigned to execute CLM processes. For a contract against an Entity-Specific Category, the Contracting Specialist/Lead is assigned from the Entity managing the category. For a contract created against a Common Category, the Contracting Specialist/Lead is assigned from the GPO.\n\ng) Contract Administrators are End-Users assigned to execute the contract.",
